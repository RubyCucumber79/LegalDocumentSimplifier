CIVIL APPEAL NO. 7 OF 2022
[arising out of S.L.P.(C) No.24278 of 2019]

I-Pay Clearing Services Private Limited .. Appellant

VS.

ICICI Bank Limited ...Respondent

JUDGMENT

R. SUBHASH REDDY, J.

1. Leave granted.

2. This appeal is filed, aggrieved by the order dated
16.07.2019 passed by the High Court of Judicature at
Bombay, in Commercial Notice of Motion No.1549 of 2019

in Commercial Arbitration Petition No.190 of 2018.

3. In the Commercial Arbitration Petition No.190 of
2018, filed under Section 34 of the Arbitration and

Sinaturenotveried CONCiliation Act, 1996 (for short ‘the Act’), the

respondent-ICICI Bank has challenged the award dated

13.11.2017, of the learned Sole Arbitrator. By _ the
C.A.@S.L.P.(C)No.24278 of 2019

aforesaid award, learned Arbitrator directed the

respondent-ICICI Bank as under: -

“Aa ) The respondent (ICICI Bank) is
ordered and directed to pay to _ the
claimant (I-pay ) an amount of
Rs.50,00,00,000/- (Rupees Fifty Crores)
together with interest thereon to be
calculated at the rate of 18% per annum
as from the date of award till payment
or realization, whichever is earlier;

b) The respondent (ICICI Bank) is
ordered and directed to pay to _ the
Claimant (I-pay) Rs.50,000/- (Rupees
Fifty Thousand ) as cost on the
application under Section 16 made before
this Arbitral Tribunal.”

4. In the petition, filed by the respondent-ICICI Bank
under Section 34(1) of the Act, it has taken out Notice
of Motion No.550 of 2018 seeking interim order to stay
the effect, operation, implementation and execution of
the award dated 13.11.2017, passed by the _ learned
Arbitrator. In the same petition, the appellant/I-Pay
has taken out Notion of Motion No.1549 of 2019, under
Section 34(4) of the Act, seeking directions to adjourn
the proceedings for a period of three months or such
other time as may be determined by the Court, and direct
the learned Arbitrator to issue appropriate directions/
instructions / additional reasons and / or to take such
necessary and appropriate action. The High Court by a
common order, has passed the conditional order in the

Notice of Motion taken out by the respondent’ and
C.A.@S.L.P.(C)No.24278 of 2019

dismissed the Notice of Motion No.1549 of 2019, taken
out by the appellant herein, under Section 34(4) of the
Act. Aggrieved by the order of dismissal, dismissing the
Notice of Motion No.1549 of 2019 filed under Section

34(4) of the Act, this Appeal is filed.

5. The appellant 1s a Private Limited Company
incorporated under Companies Act, 1956 and is in the
business of providing card personalization, transaction
and reconciliation management for Smart Card _ based
loyalty programs, for which they have an operations
facility at Mumbai, with operational hubs in various
cities. The  respondent-ICICI Bank 1S a_- company
incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956, is licensed
under Banking Regulations Act, 1949 and carries on the
business of providing banking facilities, retail
financial assistance and related activities. The HPCL
(Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited) which was
Originally impleaded as Defendent No.2 in the Suit, is a
Public Sector Company, which is engaged in refining and
selling petroleum products through their retail outlets

all over India.

6. It is the case of the appellant that it has entered
into an agreement with the respondent on 04.11.2002 to
provide technology and manage the operations’ and

processing of the Smart Card based loyalty programs for
C.A.@S.L.P.(C)No.24278 of 2019

HPCL. It was for HPCL, which was to improve fuel sales
at their retail outlets. The appellant was required to
develop various software application packages’ for
management of Smart Card based loyalty programs. The
Said agreement was followed by another agreement dated
04.02.2003, as per which, the appellant was to develop a
software for postpaid Smart Card Loyalty Program akin to
a Credit Card under the name “Drive Smart Software”. It
is the case of the appellant that to further expand
their customer base, the respondent herein, requested
the appellant to also develop a “Drive Track Fleet Card”
management solution for the fleet industry and requested
by letter dated 10.12.2003 to treat it as an extension
for the Service Provider Agreement and appointed the
appellant for that purpose and it was named as “Drive

Track Program”.

7. It is the grievance of the appellant that in view
of sudden move by the Respondent herein, in abruptly
terminating the Service Provider Agreement’ dated
04.11.2002, it has suffered losses of over Rs.50 crores,
on account of loss of jobs of its employees, losses on
account of employee retrenchment compensation, etc. It
is also their case that on account of sudden termination
of the agreement all its operations were paralyzed. The

appellant made a total claim of Rs.95 crores against the
C.A.@S.L.P.(C)No.24278 of 2019

respondent. At first instance, a suit was filed in O.S.
No.1094 of 2012 on its Original Civil Jurisdiction in
the High Court of Judicature at Bombay. As there was a
Clause in the Agreement for arbitration, the High Court
has referred the dispute to arbitration under Section 8
of the Act by appointing Mr. Justice R.G. Sindhakar
(Retd.) as a Sole Arbitrator for resolving the dispute

between the parties.

8. Mr.Justice R.G.Sindhakar (Retd.), who was appointed
as Sole Arbitrator, has passed award dated 13.11.2017,
directing the respondent herein, to pay to the appellant
- Claimant an amount of Rs.50,00,00,000/- (Rupees Fifty
Crores) together with interest @18% per annum from the
date of award till payment and further directed to pay
an amount of Rs.50,000/- (Rupees Fifty Thousand) towards

the costs.

9. Aggrieved by the award of learned Sole Arbitrator,
the respondent-ICICI Bank has filed application under
Section 34(1) of the Act for setting aside the award. In
the said application, it is the case of the respondent
that there was accord and satisfaction between the
parties and the contractual obligations between the
parties was closed mutually and amicably. Reliance is
placed on the letter dated 01.06.2010, which was signed

by both the parties recording the terms of closure of
C.A.@S.L.P.(C)No.24278 of 2019

the contract entered between the parties and other
communications. The award of the learned Arbitrator was
mainly questioned on the ground that it suffers from
patent illegality, inasmuch as there is no- finding
recorded in the award to show that the respondent -ICICI
Bank has illegally and abruptly terminated the contract.
The learned Arbitrator has framed five points’ for
determination and Point No.1 was, “Whether the contract
was illegally and abruptly terminated by the
respondent?”, The main ground in the application filed
under Section 34(1) of the Act by the Respondent, is
that the learned Arbitrator without’ recording any
finding on Point No.1, has awarded Rs.50 crores to the
appellant/I-Pay. It is pleaded in the application that
the award of the Arbitrator does not reveal the exact
nature of the purported breach and the date of alleged
termination. It is the case of the respondent’ that
without addressing the vital issue viz. whether there
was an illegal and abrupt termination of the contract or
not, as pleaded, the learned Arbitrator has allowed the
claim to the extent of Rs.50 crores, as such, the same

is patently illegal and erroneous.

10. In the arbitration petition filed by the
respondent, the appellant/I-Pay has taken out Notice of

Motion under Section 34(4) of the Act, for adjourning
C.A.@S.L.P.(C)No.24278 of 2019

the proceedings for aeperiod of three months’ by
directing the learned Arbitrator to issue appropriate
directions/ instructions / additional reasons and / or
to take such necessary and appropriate action. In the
impugned order, the High Court has prima facie found
that unless and until a finding is recorded on point
no.1 first, the learned Arbitrator could not have
proceeded to record findings on the claims made by the
appellant, as such, the learned Arbitrator has committed

jurisdictional error.

The High Court was of the view that the defect in
the award is not curable, as such, there is no merit in
the application filed by the appellant under Section

34(4) of the Act and dismissed the same.

11. We have heard Dr. Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Mr.
Nakul Dewan, learned Senior Counsels appearing for the
appellant/I-Pay and Mr. K.V.Vishwanathan, learned Senior

Counsel appearing for the respondent-ICICI Bank.

12. By impugned order, the Notice of Motion moved by
the appellant for remitting the matter to the Sole
Arbitrator under Section 34(4) of the Act, has_ been
rejected. It is the case of the appellant that though
the Arbitrator has awarded compensation/damages in view
of the case of the appellant that the contract between
the parties was illegally and abruptly terminated by the

7
C.A.@S.L.P.(C)No.24278 of 2019

respondent, but he has not recorded detailed reasons on
the said point. On the other hand, it is the case of the
respondent, that there was full accord and satisfaction
between the parties, as such, appellant is not entitled
for any compensation/damages, as claimed for. To prove
the case that there was ‘accord and_ satisfaction’
between the parties, the respondent has filed certain
communications between the parties including letter
dated 01.06.2010. It is the contention of Dr.Abhishek
Manu Singhvi, learned senior counsel appearing for the
appellant, that though the issue was resolved by the
Arbitrator by holding that there was no accord and
Satisfaction between the parties, however, he_ has
omitted to give adequate reasons in support of point
no.1. Thus, it is pleaded that in view of settled legal
position that lack of reasons or gaps in the reasoning,
is a curable defect under Section 34(4) of the Act,
award can be remitted to the arbitrator to give reasons.
In support of said plea that lack of reasons or gaps in
reasoning in the award of the Arbitrator is a curable
defect, reliance is placed on the judgments of this
Court, in the cases of Kinnari Mullick and Anr. vv.
Ghanshyam Das Damanit, Dyna Technologies Pvt. Ltd. v.

Crompton Greaves Ltd.? and also in Som Datt Builders

* (2018) 11 SCC 328
*(2019) SCC ONLINE SC 1656
C.A.@S.L.P.(C)No.24278 of 2019

Limited v. State of Kerala’. It is submitted that the
language of Section 34(4) of the Act, is couched in very
wide terms and provides for remission of the matter to
enable the Arbitrator to take such steps, as may be
necessary for elimination of grounds for setting aside
the award. It is submitted, though there is sufficient
evidence in support of the point no.1, the Arbitrator
has not given adequate reasons in support of the said
point in the award. It is pleaded that Section 34(4) of
the Act is based on the Article 34(4) of UNCITRAL Model
Law on International Commercial Arbitration, which came
up for consideration before the Singapore Court of
Appeals in the case of AKN & Anr. v. ALC & Ors.%,
wherein, it was held that remission is a ‘Curative
alternative’ to setting aside the award. Reference is
also made to the judgment of Singapore High Court in the
case of Permasteelisa Pacific Holdings Ltd. v. Hyundai

Engineering & Construction Co. Ltd.?’.

13. Shri Nakul Dewan, learned senior counsel for the
appellant, supplementing the arguments, has_ submitted
that the power to remit was conceived of as_ an
alternative to setting aside the award. It is submitted
that categorical statutory aim of sending a matter back
to the Arbitral Tribunal for remission, is to eliminate

7(2009) 10 SCC 259
*(2015) SGCA 63
°(2005) SGHC 33
C.A.@S.L.P.(C)No.24278 of 2019

defects which would preserve the award. Thus, it is
Submitted that all the defects in an arbitral award,
which are capable of being remedied, ought to be
addressed in remission proceedings, if an application
under Section 34(4) of the Act is filed. Again referring
to the judgment of this Court in the case of Dyna
Technologies Pvt. Ltd. v. Crompton Greaves Ltd.’?, learned
senior counsel has submitted that the provision under
Section 34(4) of the Act can be utilised in cases where
the arbitral award does not provide any reasoning or if
the award has some gaps in the reasoning. Learned senior
counsels, with the above submissions, requested to set
aside the impugned order and to issue directions for
remitting the award to Arbitral Tribunal for
consideration of the issue, on abrupt and illegal
termination of the agreement entered between the parties

and to give detailed reasons.

14. On the other hand, Shri K.V. Vishwanathan, learned
senior counsel for the respondent has made following

Subm1SSi10ONS:

The Notice of Motion moved by the appellant is
dismissed by the High Court by assigning valid reasons
in the impugned order and in view of the same, no
interference is called for. No grounds are made out in

the application filed by the appellant for remitting the

10
C.A.@S.L.P.(C)No.24278 of 2019

matter to the Arbitrator, and in fact, the Arbitrator
has not considered the relevant documentary evidence
produced on behalf of the respondent, and passed the
award. As the Arbitrator has passed the award by
ignoring important and relevant evidence on record, it
suffers from perversity and patent illegality, which
cannot be cured on remittal under Section 34(4) of the
Act by the Arbitrator. Under guise of adding reasons,
the Arbitrator cannot take contrary view against the
award itself. The Arbitrator in resumption proceedings
cannot change his award and the same would be contrary
to provision under Section 34(4) of the Act and would
amount to Arbitrator assuming the role of the Court,
which alone iS empowered to set aside the award. It is
Submitted that in spite of sufficient evidence on record
to prove that there was ‘accord and satisfaction’
between the parties, without considering such evidence,
the Arbitrator has proceeded on the premise that there
was no ‘accord and satisfaction’ and passed the award in
favour of the appellant. The findings recorded on the
plea of ‘accord and satisfaction’ in the award without
considering the entire evidence on record, constitute
patent illegality, as such, same is to be considered
only by the Court while considering the application
filed under Section 34(1) of the Act. Even assuming that
on remittal, the Arbitrator wants to consciously hold

11
C.A.@S.L.P.(C)No.24278 of 2019

that there was accord and satisfaction of claims and
there was no abrupt and illegal termination of the
contract, he would not be able to do so, as he cannot
change his own award. The Judgments relied on by learned
counsel for the appellant are distinguishable on facts
and would not render any support to the case of the
appellant. Oral submissions made before this Court, run

contrary to pleadings on record in the application.

15. To differentiate between ‘findings’ and ‘reasons’,
learned senior counsel Mr. K. V. Vishwanathan relied on
the judgment of this Court in the case of Income Tax
Officer, A Ward, Sitapur v. Murlidhar Bhagwan Das®. It is
also submitted that the Notice of Motion moved by the
appellant under Section 34(4) of the Act, is belated and
afterthought and is made only to- protract’~ the

litigation, and prayed for dismissal of the appeal.

16. Before we consider the various submissions made on
behalf of both sides, we need to notice certain relevant
provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act,
1996. Section 31 of the Act deals with ‘form and
contents of arbitral award’. As per the same, = an
arbitral award shall be made in writing and shall be
Signed by the members of the Arbitral Tribunal. The

arbitral award shall state the reasons, upon which it is

° AIR 1965 SC 342
12
C.A.@S.L.P.(C)No.24278 of 2019

based, unless parties agree that no reasons are to be
given, or the award is an arbitral award on agreed terms
under Section 30 of the Act. Chapter VII of the Act
provides recourse against arbitral award. The recourse
to a Court against an arbitral award is to be in terms
of Section 34(1) of the Act. AS per Section 34(2A) of
the Act, if the arbitral award arising out’ of
arbitrations other than international commercial
arbitrations, is vitiated by patent illegality, same is
a ground for setting aside the award. Sections 34(2A),

(3) & (4) of the Act, read as under:

“34.(2A) An arbitral award arising out of
arbitrations other than international
commercial arbitrations, may also be set
aside by the Court, if the Court finds that
the award is vitiated by patent illegality
appearing on the face of the award:

Provided that an award shall not be
set aside merely on the ground of = an
erroneous application of the law or by
reappreciation of evidence.

(3) An application for setting aside may not
be made after three months have elapsed from
the date on which the party making that
application had received the arbitral award
or, if a request had been made under section
33, from the date on which that request had
been disposed of by the arbitral tribunal;

Provided that if the Court’ is
satisfied that the application was prevented
by sufficient cause from making the
application within the said period of three
months it may entertain the application
within a further period of thirty days, but
not thereafter.

(4) On receipt of an application under sub-
section (1), the Court may, where it is
appropriate and it 1S so requested by a

13
C.A.@S.L.P.(C)No.24278 of 2019

party, adjourn the proceedings for a period

of time determined by it in order to give the

arbitral tribunal an opportunity to resume

the arbitral proceedings or to take_ such

other action as in the opinion of arbitral

tribunal will eliminate the grounds’ for

setting aside the arbitral award.”
17. From a reading of Section 34(4) of the Act, it is
Clear that on receipt of an application under sub-
section (1), in appropriate cases on a request by a
party, Court may adjourn the proceedings for a period
determined by it in the order to give the Arbitral
Tribunal an opportunity to resume the - arbitral
proceedings or to take such other action as in the

opinion of Arbitral Tribunal, will eliminate the grounds

for setting aside the arbitral award.

18. It is the case of the appellant that in view of
abrupt and illegal termination of agreement by _ the
respondent, it has suffered losses of more than Rs.50
crores as all operations were paralysed, and_ the
appellant had to pay its employees’ retrenchment
compensation, etc. On the aforesaid grounds, a total
Claim of Rs.95 crores was made against the respondent.
On the other hand, it is the case of the respondent that
there was ‘accord and satisfaction’ between the parties
and the same is evident from several letters, which are
part of record in the arbitration proceedings. Reliance

is placed on the documentary evidence i.e. letters dated

14
C.A.@S.L.P.(C)No.24278 of 2019

01.06.2010, 17.06.2010, email dated 02.08.2010 and
letters dated 08.11.2010 & 20.01.2011. It is. the
specific case of the respondent that learned Arbitrator
failed to appreciate such evidence, which’ would
establish their case that there was = accord -= and
satisfaction between the parties and there was no abrupt
termination or any breach on their part. It is their
case that in view of such omission to consider vital
evidence on record, findings recorded by the Arbitrator
are perverse and constitute patent illegality within the
meaning of Section 34(2A) of the Act. The Notice of
Motion filed under Section 34(4) of the Act by the
appellant, clearly states that the said Motion was moved
as an abundant precaution and they are seeking remission
to the Arbitrator to provide detail and express reasons
in addition to reasons already stated in the arbitral
award dated 13.11.2017. It is also their case that it is
essential that additional reasons are made available by
learned Arbitrator in support of his findings recorded
in the award. On the other hand, it is the case of the
respondent, that there is no finding at all, on the
issue viz. “whether the contract was illegally and
abruptly terminated by the respondent?”, and in spite of
the same, the Arbitrator without considering’ the
important documents/communications between the parties,
which throw light on accord and satisfaction between the

15
C.A.@S.L.P.(C)No.24278 of 2019

parties, has proceeded to pass the award stating that

there was no ‘accord and satisfaction’.

19. As contended by learned senior counsel for the
appellant, it is true that Section 34(4) of the Act is
couched in a language, similar to Article 34(4) of the
UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial
Arbitration. In the case of AKN & Anr. v. ALC & Ors.‘*, by
considering legislative history of the Model Law, it was
held by Singapore Court of Appeals that remission is a
“Curative alternative’. In the case of Kinnari Mullick
and Anr. v. Ghanshyam Das Damani*, relied on by learned
senior counsel for the appellant, the question which
fell for consideration was whether Section 34(4) of the
Act empowers the Court to relegate the parties before
the Arbitral Tribunal after setting aside the arbitral
award, in absence of any application by the parties. In
fact, in the said judgment, it is held that’ the
quintessence for exercising power under Section 34(4) of
the Act is to enable the Tribunal to take such measures
which can eliminate the grounds for setting aside the
arbitral award, by curing the defects in the award. In
the judgment in the case of Dyna Technologies Pvt. Ltd.
v. Crompton Greaves Ltd.’, it was a case where there was
no inguiry under Section 34(4) of the Act and in the

Said case, this Court has held that the legislative

16
C.A.@S.L.P.(C)No.24278 of 2019

intention behind Section 34(4) of the Act, is to make
the award enforceable, after giving an opportunity to
the Tribunal to undo the curable defects. It was not a
case of patent illegality in the award, but deficiency
in the award due to lack of reasoning for a finding
which was already recorded in the award. In the very
Same case, it is also clearly held that when there is a
complete perversity in the reasoning, then the same is a
ground to challenge the award under Section 34(1) of the
Act. The case of Som Datt Builders Limited v. State of
Kerala®? is also a case where no reasons are given for the
finding already recorded in the award, as such, this
Court held that in view of Section 34(4) of the Act, the
High Court ought to have given Arbitral Tribunal an

Opportunity to give reasons.

20. The aforesaid case law cited by the learned counsel
appearing for the appellant, is distinguishable on facts
and would not render any assistance in this case. When
it is the specific case of the respondent that there is
no finding at all, on point no.1 viz. “whether the
contract was illegally and abruptly terminated by the
respondent?”, remission under Section 34(4) of the Act,
is not permissible. In our view, Section 34(4) of the
Act, can be resorted to record reasons on the finding

already given in the award or to fill up the gaps in the

17
C.A.@S.L.P.(C)No.24278 of 2019

reasoning of the award. There is a difference between
‘finding’ and ‘reasons’ as pointed out by the learned
senior counsel appearing for the respondent in the
judgment in the case of Income Tax Officer, A Ward,
Sitapur v. Murlidhar Bhagwan Das*®. It is clear from the
aforesaid judgment that ‘finding is a decision on an
issue’. Further, in the judgment in the case of J.
Ashoka v. University of Agricultural Sciences and Ors.’,
this Court has held that ‘reasons are the links between
the materials on which certain conclusions are based and
the actual conclusions’. In absence of any finding on
point no.1, as pleaded by the respondent and further, it
is their case that relevant material produced before the
Arbitrator to prove ‘accord and satisfaction’ between
the parties, is not considered, and the same amounts to
patent illegality, such aspects are to be considered by
the Court itself. It cannot be said that it 1S a case
where additional reasons are to be given or gaps in the
reasoning, in absence of a finding on point no.1 viz.
“whether the contract was illegally and abruptly

terminated by the respondent?”

21. Further, Section 34(4) of the Act itself makes it
clear that it is the discretion vested with the Court
for remitting the matter to Arbitral Tribunal to give an

Opportunity to resume the proceedings or not. The words
’(2017) 2 SCC 609
18
C.A.@S.L.P.(C)No.24278 of 2019

“where it 1S appropriate” itself indicate that it is
the discretion to be exercised by the Court, to remit
the matter when requested by a party. When application
is filed under Section 34(4) of the Act, the same is to
be considered keeping in mind the grounds raised in the
application under Section 34(1) of the Act by the party,
who has questioned the award of the Arbitral Tribunal
and the grounds raised in the application filed under
Section 34(4) of the Act and the reply thereto. Merely
because an application is filed under Section 34(4) of
the Act by a party, it is not always obligatory on the
part of the Court to remit the matter to Arbitral
Tribunal. The discretionary power conferred under
Section 34(4) of the Act, is to be exercised where there
is inadequate reasoning or to fill up the gaps in the
reasoning, in support of the findings which are already
recorded in the award. Under guise of additional reasons
and filling up the gaps in the reasoning, no award can
be remitted to the Arbitrator, where there are no
findings on the contentious issues in the award. If
there are no findings on the contentious issues in the
award or if any findings are recorded ignoring the
material evidence on record, the same are acceptable
grounds for setting aside the award itself. Under guise
of either additional reasons or filling up the gaps in
the reasoning, the power conferred on the Court cannot

19
C.A.@S.L.P.(C)No.24278 of 2019

be relegated to the Arbitrator. In absence of any
finding on contentious issue, no amount of reasons can
cure the defect in the award. A harmonious reading of
Section 31, 34(1), 34(2A) and 34(4) of the Arbitration
and Conciliation Act, 1996, make it clear that in
appropriate cases, on the request made by a party, Court
can give an opportunity to the arbitrator to resume the
arbitral proceedings for giving reasons or to fill up
the gaps in the reasoning in support of a finding, which
is already rendered in the award. But at the same time,
when it prima facie appears that there is a patent
illegality in the award itself, by not recording a
finding on a contentious issue, in such cases, Court may
not accede to the request of a party for giving an
Opportunity to the Arbitral Tribunal to resume the
arbitral proceedings. Further, as rightly contended by
the learned counsel appearing for the respondent, that
on the plea of ‘accord and satisfaction’ on _ further
consideration of evidence, which is ignored earlier,
even if the arbitral tribunal wants to consciously hold
that there was ‘accord and satisfaction’ between the
parties, it cannot do so by altering the award itself,

which he has already passed.

22. For the foregoing reasons, we do not find any merit

in this appeal so as to interfere with the impugned

20
C.A.@S.L.P.(C)No.24278 of 2019

order passed by the High Court. Accordingly, this Civil

Appeal is dismissed, with no order as to costs.

Leave granted.

These appeals are preferred, by the State-owned Undertaking,

Kerala State Beverages Manufacturing & Marketing Corporation Ltd., a

1
C.A.@S.L.P.(C)No.12859 of 2020 etc.

company registered under the Companies Act, 1956, engaged in the
wholesale and retail trade of beverages, aggrieved by the common
judgment and order dated 30.04.2020 passed in I.T.A. No.135; 146 and
313 of 2019 by the High Court of Kerala at Ernakulam. The Civil
Appeal arising out of S.L.P.(C)No.12859 of 2020 is filed by the assessee

and other three appeals are preferred by the revenue.

3. For the assessment year 2014-2015, the Deputy Commissioner
of Income Tax, Circle-2(1), Thiruvananthapuram finalised the
assessment of income of the appellant under Section 143(8) of the
Income-tax Act, 1961 (in short, ‘the Act’) vide Assessment Order dated
14.12.2016. The Principal Commissioner of Income _ Tax,
Thiruvananthapuram has exercised power of revision as contemplated
under Section 263 of the Act and set aside order of assessment on the
ground that same is erroneous and is prejudicial to the interest of the
revenue, to the extent it failed to disallow the debits made in the Profit
& Loss Account of the assessee, with respect to the amount of
surcharge on sales tax and turnover tax paid to the State Government,
which ought to have been disallowed under Section 4O(a)(iib) of the Act.

Against order of the Principal Commissioner, Income Tax, dated
C.A.@S.L.P.(C)No.12859 of 2020 etc.

25.09.2018, the appellant herein filed appeal before the Income Tax
Appellate Tribunal (in short, ‘the Tribunal’) in ITA No.536/Coch/2018.
4. With respect to Assessment Year 2015-2016 assessment
against the appellant was completed under Section 143(3) of the Act by
the Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax, Circle-1(1),
Thiruvananthapuram vide order of assessment dated 28.12.2017.
Debits contained in the Profit & Loss Account of the appellant with
respect to payment of gallonage fee, licence fee, shop rental (kist) and
surcharge on_ sales tax, amounting to a total sum _. of
Rs.811,90,88,115/- were disallowed under Section 40(a)(iib) of the Act.
Aggrieved by the said order, appellant herein has filed appeal before the
Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals), Thiruvananthapuram and the
same was dismissed. The appellant carried the matter by way of
second appeal before the Tribunal in ITA No.537/Coch/2018.

The Tribunal has dismissed the ITA Nos.536-537/Coch/2018 by a
common order dated 12.03.2019. The appellant herein thereafter has
filed miscellaneous application in MP No.47/Coch/2019 on the ground
that the Tribunal had failed to consider the issue agitated against the
disallowance of the surcharge on sales tax. The said miscellaneous
application was allowed by recalling earlier order dated 12.03.2019

passed in I.T.A.No.537/Coch/2018 and a fresh order was passed on

3
C.A.@S.L.P.(C)No.12859 of 2020 etc.

11.10.2019, finding the issue against the appellant and dismissing the
appeal. Aggrieved by the aforesaid three orders, the appellant herein
has filed Income Tax Appeals before the High Court in ITA Nos.135; 146
and 313 of 2019 which are disposed, by the common impugned order.
In the common impugned order passed by the High Court, the question
of law raised, was answered partly in favour of the assessee/appellant
and partly in favour of the revenue. Para 23 and 24 of the judgment
read as under :

“23. While summing up the conclusions, we are
persuaded to answer the question of law raised, partly in
favour of the revenue and partly in favour of the
assessee. We hold that the levy of Gallonage Fee, Licence
Fee and Shop Rental (kist) with respect to the FL-9
licences granted to the appellant will clearly fall within
the purview of Section 40 (a) (iib) and the amount paid in
this regard is liable to be disallowed. The amount of
Gallonage Fee, Licence Fee, or Shop Rental (kist) paid
with respect to FL-1 licences granted in favour of the
appellant, with respect to the retail business in foreign
liquor, is not an exclusive levy on the appellant, which is
a state government undertaking. Therefore the
disallowance made with respect to those amounts cannot
be sustained. The surcharge on sales tax and turnover
tax is not a ‘fee or charge' coming within the scope of
Section 40 (a) (iib) and is not an amount which can be
disallowed under the said provision. Therefore the
disallowance made in this regard is liable to be set aside.

24. In the result the assessment completed against the
appellants with respect to the assessment years 2014-
2015, 2015-2016 are hereby set aside. The matter is
remitted to the Assessing Officer to pass revised orders,
after computing the I.T. Appeal Nos. 135, 146 &

4
C.A.@S.L.P.(C)No.12859 of 2020 etc.

313/2019 -32- liability in accordance with the position
settled hereinabove, on affording an opportunity of
hearing to the appellant. The needful steps in this regard
shall be completed at the earliest, at any rate, within
three months from the date of receipt of a copy of this
judgment.”

5. For the purpose of disposal, we refer to the parties, as arrayed
in the appeal filed by Kerala State Beverages Manufacturing &

Marketing Corporation Ltd. (KSBC).

6. We have heard Sri S. Ganesh, learned senior advocate for the
appellant and Sri N. Venkataraman, learned Additional Solicitor
General appearing for the respondent.
7. Section 40 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 is the provision dealing
with ‘amounts not deductible’. The amounts as detailed in the Section
are not deductible, in computing the income chargeable under the head
“Profits and gains of business or profession”. By the Finance Act, 2013
(Act 17 of 2013), Section 40 of the Act is amended by inserting Section
AO(a)(iib), which has come into force from 01.04.2014. The said
provision under Section 40(a)(iib) reads as under :
“40. Amounts not deductible.- Notwithstanding any-
thing contrary in sections 30 to 38, the following
amounts shall not be deducted in computing the income

chargeable under the head “Profits and gains of business
or profession”, -
C.A.@S.L.P.(C)No.12859 of 2020 etc.

(iib) any amount -

(A)

(B)

paid by way of royalty, licence fee, service fee,
privilege fee, service charge or any other fee or
charge, by whatever name called, which is levied
exclusively on; or

which is appropriated, directly or indirectly,
from,

a State Government undertaking by the State Gov-
ernment.

Explanation.-For the purposes of this sub-clause, a

a company in which more than fifty per cent of
the paid-up equity share capital is held by the
state Government;

a company in which more than fifty per cent of
the paid-up equity share capital is held by the en-
tity referred to in clause (i) or clause (ii) (whether
singly or taken together);

a company or corporation in which the State Gov-
ernment has the right to appoint the majority of
the directors or to control the management or
policy decisions, directly or indirectly, including
by virtue of its shareholding or management
rights or shareholders agreements or voting
agreements or in any other manner;
C.A.@S.L.P.(C)No.12859 of 2020 etc.

(v) an authority, a board or an institution or a body
established or constituted by or under any Act of
the State Government or owned or controlled by
the State Government;".

8. While it is the case of the assessee/appellant that the
gallonage fees, licence fee and shop rental (kist) for FL-9 licence and FL-
1 licence, the surcharge on sales tax and turnover tax do not fall within
the purview of the abovesaid amended Section, the case of the revenue
is that all the aforesaid amounts are covered under Section 40(a)(iib) as
such, such amounts are not deductible for the purpose of computation
of income, for the assessment years 2014-2015 and 2015-2016.

9. During the assessment years 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 the
appellant was holding FL-9 and FL-1 licences to deal in wholesale and
retail of, Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) and Foreign Made Foreign
Liquor (FMFL) granted by the Excise Department. FL-9 licence was
issued to deal in wholesale liquor, which they were selling to FL-1, FL-
3, FL-4, 4A, FL-11, FL-12 licence holders. The FL-1 licence was for sale
of foreign liquor in sealed bottles, without privilege of consumption
within the premises. The gallonage fee is payable as per Section 18A of
the Kerala Abkari Act and Rule 15A of the Foreign Liquor Rules. The

appellant was the only licence holder for the relevant years so far as FL-
C.A.@S.L.P.(C)No.12859 of 2020 etc.

9 licence to deal in wholesale, and so far as FL-1 licences are
concerned, it was also granted to one other State owned Undertaking,
i.e., Kerala State Co-operatives Consumers’ Federation Ltd.. By
interpreting the word ‘exclusively’ as worded in Section 4O(a)(iib)(A) of
the Act, High Court in the impugned order has held that the levy of
gallonage fee, licence fee and shop rental (kisf) with respect to FL-9
licences granted to the appellant will clearly fall within the purview of
Section 40O(a)(iib) of the Act and the amounts paid in this regard is
liable to be disallowed. At the same time the amount of gallonage fee,
licence fee and shop rental (kist) paid with respect to FL-1 licences
granted in favour of the appellant for retail business, the High Court
has held that it is not an exclusive levy, as such disallowance made
with respect to the same cannot be sustained. With regard to
surcharge on sales tax and turnover tax, it is held that same is nota
‘fee’ or ‘charge’ within the meaning of Section 40(a)(iib) as such same is
not an amount which can be disallowed under the said provision.

10. Sri Ganesh, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant
by referring to Explanatory Note to the Finance Act, 2013, and Section
AO(a)(iib) of the Act, has submitted that the levy of gallonage fees,
licence fee and shop rental (kist) on FL-9 licence is not on any State

Government Undertaking but same is a levy on the licensee. It is

8
C.A.@S.L.P.(C)No.12859 of 2020 etc.

submitted that the levy was on the licence holder whoever he or it
might be and only in view of the Abkari Policy of the relevant years
licences were granted to the appellant as such it cannot be said that
same was exclusive levy on the appellant attracting Section 40(a)(iib) of
the Act so as to disallow the same. It is submitted that the mere fact
that in a particular year, the licence holder happens to be State
Government Undertaking does not make the levy, one, which is
imposed directly and exclusively on the State Government Undertaking.
It is submitted that High Court has failed to appreciate that the
decision as to whom FL-9 licences are to be granted, depends only on
the State Government’s Abkari Policy, which may vary from year to
year. It is submitted that said submission also holds good with regard
to gallonage fee, licence fee and shop rental for FL-1 licence, which
issue is already decided in favour of appellant, by the High Court. With
regard to surcharge on sales tax and turnover tax, it is submitted that
taxes levied, are completely outside the ambit of Section 4O(a)(iib) of the
Act. It is submitted that the Kerala Surcharge on Taxes Act, 1957 (for
short, ‘KST Act’) is enacted only to increase the taxes, inter alia, on the
sale or purchase of goods, as such it is nothing but an increment to the
basic sales tax levied under Section 5(1) of Kerala General Sales Tax

Act, 1963 (for short, “‘KGST Act). It is submitted that surcharge on

9
C.A.@S.L.P.(C)No.12859 of 2020 etc.

sales tax is nothing but an enhancement of tax itself. In support of the

said submission, the learned counsel has placed reliance on the
judgments of this Court in the case of C.I.T. v. K. Srinivasan’ and in

the case of Sarojini Tea Co. Ltd. v. Collector, Dibrugarh’. Reference
is also made on the CBDT Circular No.3/2018 dated 11.07.2018, to
buttress the said submission. Learned counsel, by drawing our
attention to the distinction between ‘fee’ and ‘taxes’ which is
maintained throughout the scheme under Section 40(a) has submitted
that, the sales tax and turnover tax is outside the scope of Section 40(a)
(iib) of the Act. Lastly it is submitted that for the assessment year
2014-2015, the assessing officer has allowed deductions in respect of
surcharge on sales tax and turnover tax, the Commissioner interfered,
in exercise of power of revision under Section 263 of the Act. It is
submitted that the view taken by the assessing officer was a possible
view, as such the very invocation of revisional power was not
permissible, to interfere with the order of the assessing officer.

With the aforesaid submissions, learned counsel has submitted to
allow the appeal filed by the assessee and dismiss the appeals filed by

the revenue.

C.A.@S.L.P.(C)No.12859 of 2020 etc.

11. Sri Venkataraman, learned ASG appearing for the revenue, by
drawing our attention to the provisions under Articles 285 and 289 of
the Constitution of India, has explained the intent behind the
amendment to Section 40 of the Income-tax Act, 1961, by Act 17 of
2013. It is submitted that in terms of Article 289 of the Constitution,
the property and income of a State is exempted from Union taxation.
The constitutional protection under Article 289 had led the States in
shifting income/profits from the State Government Undertakings into
Consolidated Fund of the States. It is submitted that State
Government Undertaking — KSBC, which in this case is a company like
any other commercial concern, is engaged in trade and business and
commercial activity, therefore, is to be treated like any other business
entity. However, when it came to filing of Return of Income, the State
as the only shareholder or major shareholder in this type of
undertakings, exercise control over it and shift profits by appropriating
the whole of the surplus or a part of it by way of taxes, fee or similar
such appropriations. It is submitted that this resulted in erosion of
profits in the hands of State Government Undertakings leading to lesser
payment of taxes, since these appropriations by the respective States
from their State Government Undertakings were accounted for as

allowable expenditure under Section 40O(a) and these undertakings

11
C.A.@S.L.P.(C)No.12859 of 2020 etc.

claimed deduction of the same from the income earned, therefore could
not be taxed in the hands of the State Government Undertakings. It is
further submitted that the shifted profit, upon its transfer, went into
the Consolidated Fund of the States and on this basis constitutional
protection under Article 289 were claimed as a result of which, these
amounts could neither be taxed in the hands of the State Government
Undertakings nor in the hands of the respective States. Precisely the
underlined spirit in bringing out the said amendment by inserting
Section 40(a)(iib), is to plug the possible diversion or shifting of profits
from these undertakings into State’s treasury. Learned counsel also
referred to the Memorandum attached to the Finance Bill of 2013 which
explains the provisions relating to direct taxes. The relevant portion of

the Memorandum reads as under:

“Disallowance of certain fee, charge, etc. in the case of
State Government Undertakings

The existing provisions of section 40 specifies the
amounts which shall not be deducted in computing the
income chargeable under the head “Profits and gains of
business or profession”. The non-deductible expense
under the said section also includes statutory dues like
fringe benefit tax, income-tax, wealth-tax, etc.

Disputes have arisen in respect of income-tax assessment
of some State Government undertakings as to whether
any sum paid by way of privilege fee, license fee, royalty,
etc. levied or charged by the State Government exclusively

12
C.A.@S.L.P.(C)No.12859 of 2020 etc.

11.1.
(kist), it is submitted that High Court has upheld the disallowance in
favour of the revenue with regard to FL-9 licence on the ground that the
appellant — KSBC is the exclusive licence holder, so far as FL-9 licences
are concerned.

concerned only on the ground that similar licences are also given for

on its undertakings are deductible or not for the purposes
of computation of income of such undertakings. In some
cases, orders have been issued to the effect that surplus
arising to such undertakings shall vest with the State
Government. As a result it has been claimed that such
income by way of surplus is not subject to tax. It is a
settled law that State Government undertakings are
separate legal entities than the State and are liable to
income-tax.

In order to protect the tax base of State Government
undertakings vis-a-vis exclusive levy of fee, charge, etc. or
appropriation of amount by the State Governments from
its undertakings, it is proposed to amend section 40 of the
Income-tax Act to provide that any amount paid by way of
fee, charge, etc., which is levied exclusively on, or any
amount appropriated, directly or indirectly, from a State
Government undertaking, by the State Government, shall
not be allowed as deduction for the purposes of
computation of income of such undertakings under the
head “Profits and gains of business or profession”. It is
also proposed to define the expression “State Government
Undertaking” for this purpose.

This amendment will take effect from 1st April, 2014 and
will, accordingly, apply in relation to the assessment year
2014-15 and subsequent assessment years.”

With regard to gallonage fees, licence fee and the shop rental

13

It is submitted that so far as FL-1 licences are
C.A.@S.L.P.(C)No.12859 of 2020 etc.

another licence holder, viz., to Kerala State Co-operatives Consumers’
Federation Ltd., the High Court has held that there is no exclusivity so
far as FL-1 licences are concerned. It is the contention of the learned
counsel that the disallowance under Section 4O(a)(iib) is not contingent
upon the nature of licence. The test should be whether levy under the
Abkari Act is exclusive or not and in this case it is exclusive. It is
submitted that the restricted interpretation made by the High Court to
the extent of FL-1 licences issued in favour of the appellant runs
contrary to object and intent of Section 4O(a)(iib) of the Act and makes
the said provision redundant and otiose. It is the case of the revenue
that the aspect of exclusivity used under Section 4O(a)(iib) of the Act,
has to be viewed from the nature of undertaking on which levy is
imposed and not on the number of undertakings on which levy is
imposed. It is further submitted that the KSBC and the Kerala State
Co-operatives Consumers’ Federation Ltd. are undertakings of the State
of Kerala, therefore, the levy is an exclusive levy on such State
Government Undertakings which are licensees.

11.2. So far as surcharge on sales tax is concerned, again it is
submitted that such a levy is an exclusive levy on KSBC alone,
therefore, attracts Section 40(a)(iib)(A) itself. Alternatively, it is further

submitted that even assuming that such tax is not attracted by Section

14
C.A.@S.L.P.(C)No.12859 of 2020 etc.

AO(a)(iib)(A), it would fall under Section 40O(a)(iib)(B) for the reason that
surcharge on sales tax is a ‘tax’ and tax is a form of appropriation by
the State from KSBC. It is submitted that the surcharge levied under
Section 3(1) of the KST Act is on the tax payable by a dealer in foreign
liquor under Section 5(1) of the KGST Act. It is the contention of the
learned counsel that, the cumulative reading of Section 3(1) of the KST
Act and Section 5(1)(b) of the KGST Act would reveal that surcharge is
levied on the tax payable by a dealer in foreign liquor under Section 5(1)
of KGST Act. It is submitted that Section 3(1) does not deal with any
other category and specifically pertain only to a dealer in foreign liquor.
It is submitted that as much as Section 5(1)(b) of the KGST Act refers to
trade in foreign liquor and it applies specifically and exclusively to
KSBC and further surcharge levied under Section 3(1) of KST Act is on
the sales tax, exclusively payable by KSBC under Section 5(1)(b) of
KGST Act. As such, the inevitable conclusion, therefore is that it
qualifies as an exclusive levy attracting Section 4O(a)(iib) of the Act. To
show that the distinction between a ‘tax’ and a ‘fee’ has substantially
been effaced in the development of constitutional jurisprudence,

learned counsel, has placed reliance on a recent judgment of this Court

15
C.A.@S.L.P.(C)No.12859 of 2020 etc.

in the case of Jalkal Vibhag Nagar Nigam & Ors. v Pradeshiya
Industrial and Investment Corporation and Another’.

11.3. With regard to turnover tax, it is submitted that unlike
surcharge which is an exclusive levy on KSBC, it is fairly submitted
that such tax was imposed not only on KSBC under Section 5(1)(b) of
the KGST Act, but also was being imposed on various other retail
dealers specified under Section 5(2) of KGST Act. It is submitted that
as the issue has not been dealt and examined in detail by the High
Court, made a request to leave it open for fresh adjudication since facts
and figures need to be verified.

With the above submissions, learned ASG has pleaded to allow the
appeals filed by the revenue and dismiss the appeal filed by the KSBC.
12. Having heard the learned counsels on both sides we have
perused the impugned order and other material placed on record.

13. Section 40 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 is a provision which
deals with the amounts which are not deductible while computing the
income chargeable under the head ‘Profits and gains of business or
profession’. Section 40 of the Act is amended in the year 2013, and
4O(a)(iib) is inserted by Amending Act 17 of 2013, which has come into

force from 01.04.2014. In terms of Article 289 of the Constitution of

3.2021 SCC OnLine SC 960
16
C.A.@S.L.P.(C)No.12859 of 2020 etc.

India, the property and income of a State shall be exempt from Union
taxation. Therefore, in terms of Article 289, the Union is prevented
from taxing the States on its income and property. It is the
constitutional protection granted to the States in terms of the abovesaid
Article. This protection has led the States in shifting income/ profits
from the State Government Undertakings into Consolidated Fund of the
respective States to have a protection under Article 289. In the instant
case the KSBC, a State Government Undertaking, is a company like
any other commercial entity, which is engaged in the business and
trade like any other business entity for the purpose of wholesale and
retail business in liquor. As much as these kind of undertakings are
under the control of the States as the total shareholding or in some
cases majority of shareholding, is held by States. As such they exercise
control over it and shift the profits by appropriating whole of the
surplus or a part of it to the Government by way of fees, taxes or
similar such appropriations. From the relevant Memorandum to the
Finance Act, 2013 and underlying object for amendment of Income-tax
Act by Act 17 of 2013, by which Section 40(a)(iib)(A)(B) is inserted, it is
clear that the said amendment is made to plug the possible diversion or
shifting of profits from these undertakings into State’s treasury. In
view of Section 40(a)(iib) of the Act any amount, as indicated, which is

17
C.A.@S.L.P.(C)No.12859 of 2020 etc.

levied exclusively on the State owned undertaking (KSBC in the instant
case), cannot be claimed as a deduction in the books of State owned
undertaking, thus same is liable to income tax.

14. In the instant case the gallonage fee, licence fee, shop rental
(kist), surcharge and turnover tax are the amounts of which assessee
claims that they are not attracted by Section 4O(a)(iib) of the Act. On
the other hand it is the case of the respondent/revenue that all the said
components attract the ingredients of Section 4O(a)(iib)(A) or Section
40(a)(iib)(B), as such they are not deductible. Broadly these levies can
be divided into three categories. Gallonage fee, licence fee and shop
rental (kist) are in the nature of fee imposed under the Abkari Act of
1902. These are the fees payable for the licences issued under FL-9
and FL-1. In the impugned order, the High Court has held that the
gallonage fee, licence fee and shop rental (kisf) with respect to FL-9
licence are not deductible, as it is an exclusive levy on the Corporation.
Further a distinction is drawn from FL-1 licence from FL-9 licence, to
apply Section 4O(a)(iib), only on the ground that, FL-1 licences are
issued not only to the appellant/KSBC but also issued to one other
Government Undertaking, i.e., Kerala State Co-operatives Consumers’
Federation Ltd. High Court has held that as there is no other player

holding licences under FL-9 like KSBC as such the word ‘exclusivity’

18
C.A.@S.L.P.(C)No.12859 of 2020 etc.

used in Section 4O(a)(iib) attract such amounts. At the same time only
on the ground that FL-1 licences are issued not only to the KSBC but
also to Kerala State Co-operatives Consumers’ Federation Ltd., High
Court has held that exclusivity is lost so as to apply the provision
under Section 4O(a)(iib). If the amended provision under Section 40(a)
(iib) is to be read in the manner, as interpreted by the High Court, it
will literally defeat the very purpose and intention behind the
amendment. The aspect of exclusivity under Section 40(a)(iib) is not to
be considered with a narrow interpretation, which will defeat the very
intention of Legislature, only on the ground that there is yet another
player, viz., Kerala State Co-operatives Consumers’ Federation Ltd.
which is also granted licence under FL-1. The aspect of ‘exclusivity’
under Section 4O(a)(iib) has to be viewed from the nature of
undertaking on which levy is imposed and not on the number of
undertakings on which the levy is imposed. If this aspect of exclusivity
is viewed from the nature of undertaking, in this particular case, both
KSBC and Kerala State Co-operatives Consumers’ Federation Ltd. are
undertakings of the State of Kerala, therefore, levy is an exclusive levy
on the State Government Undertakings. Therefore, we are of the
considered view that any other interpretation would defeat the very
object behind the amendment to Income-tax Act, 1961.

19
C.A.@S.L.P.(C)No.12859 of 2020 etc.

14.1. It is fairly well settled that the interpretation is to be in the
manner which will subserve and promote the object and intention
behind the legislation. If it is not interpreted in the manner as
aforesaid it would defeat the very intention of the legislation. To defeat
the said provision, the State Governments may issue licences to more
than one State owned undertakings and may ultimately say it is not an
exclusive undertaking and therefore Section 4O(a)(iib) is not attracted.
The submission of Sri Ganesh, learned senior counsel for the appellant
is that the gallonage fee, licence fee and the shop rental (kisf) are the
levies under the Abkari Act on all the licence holders, as such it cannot
be said that same is an exclusive levy on the appellant/KSBC. It is
submitted that because of the AbkKari Policy in particular year, licences
are issued in favour of the appellant — State owned Undertaking, as
such it cannot be said that the statutory levies under the Abkari Act
are on the State Government Undertaking and such levies are only on
the licensees but not on the State-owned Undertakings like KSBC. The
said submission cannot be accepted for the reason that by virtue of
licence which is granted in favour of State-owned Undertaking, the
statutory fees etc., viz., gallonage fees, licence fee and shop rental (kis?)
are payable by the appellant-Undertaking, i.e., KSBC. Once the State

Government Undertaking takes licence, the statutory levies referred

20
C.A.@S.L.P.(C)No.12859 of 2020 etc.

above are on the Government Undertaking because it is granted
licences. Therefore, we are of the view that the finding of the High
Court that gallonage fee, licence fee and shop rental (kist) so far as FL-1
licences are concerned, is not attracted by Section 4O(a)(iib), cannot be
accepted and such finding of the High Court runs contrary to object
and intention behind the legislation.

14.2. Further, because another State Government Undertaking, i.e.,
Kerala State Co-operatives Consumers’ Federation Ltd. was also
granted licences during the relevant years, as such _ exclusivity
mentioned in Section 4O(a)(iib) is lost, also cannot be accepted, for the
reason that exclusivity is to be considered with reference to nature of
licence and not on number of State owned Undertakings. If the
interpretation, as held by the High Court, is accepted, the legislative
intent can be defeated by issuing licences in FL-1 to several State
Government Undertakings and then make a contention that exclusivity
is lost. Said interpretation runs contrary to the intent of the
amendment.

14.3. So far as surcharge on sales tax is concerned, the High Court
has held in favour of KSBC and against the revenue. The reasoning of
the High Court is that surcharge on sales tax is a tax and Section 40(a)

(iib) does not contemplate ‘tax’ and surcharge on sales tax is not a ‘fee’

21
C.A.@S.L.P.(C)No.12859 of 2020 etc.

or a ‘charge’. Therefore, High Court was of the view that surcharge
levied on KSBC does not attract Section 40O(a)(iib) of the Act. The
submission of Sri Venkataraman, learned ASG with regard to surcharge
on sales tax is two-fold. One is that the levy of surcharge on sales tax
is also an exclusive levy on KSBC, therefore, attracts Section 40O(a)(iib)
(A) itself. Secondly, it is submitted, as an alternative submission that if
the same is not covered by Section 4O(a)(iib)(A) it would fall under
Section 4O(a)(iib)(B) of the Act, for the reason that the surcharge on
sales tax is a tax and tax is a form of appropriation by the State from
KSBC. The learned counsel placed reliance on a recent judgment of
this Court in the case of Jalkal Vibhag Nagar Nigam and Others’. On
the other hand it is the case of the appellant/assessee that the sales
tax is outside the scope of Section 4O(a)(iib) and the surcharge is
nothing but is an enhancement of the tax. By referring to words used
in Section 40(a)(iib), learned counsel Sri Ganesh has submitted that the
said provision is to be interpreted by applying the doctrine of ejusdem
generis. It is submitted that the words ‘any other fee or charge’
immediately following the words ‘royalty, licence fee, service fee,
privilege fee, service charge’ relate to such similar charges and none of
the terms can possibly cover a tax, like sales tax or surcharge on sales

tax. With regard to surcharge on sales tax, we are in agreement with

22
C.A.@S.L.P.(C)No.12859 of 2020 etc.

the submission of Sri Ganesh, learned senior counsel appearing for
appellant. The ‘fee’ or ‘charge’ as mentioned in Section 4O(a)(iib) is
clear in terms and that will take in only ‘fee’ or ‘charge’ as mentioned
therein or any fee or charge by whatever name called, but cannot cover
tax or surcharge on tax and such taxes are outside the scope and ambit
of Section 4O(a)(iib)(A) and Section 4O(a)(iib)(B) of the Act. The
surcharge which is imposed on KSBC is under Section 3(1) of the KST

Act which reads as under :

“3. Levy of surcharge on sales and purchase taxes. -—
(1) The tax payable under sub-section (1) of section 5 of
the Kerala General Sales Tax Act, 1963, by a dealer in
foreign liquor shall be increased by a surcharge at the
rate of ten per cent, and the provisions of the Kerala
General Sales Tax Act 1963 shall apply in relation to the
said surcharge as they apply in relation to the tax
payable under the said Act.

Provided that where in respect of declared goods as
defined in clause (c) of section 2 of the Central Sales
Tax Act, 1956 the tax payable by such dealer under
the Kerala General Sales Tax Act, 1963 together
with the surcharge payable under this sub-section,
exceeds four per centum of the sale or purchase
price, the rate of surcharge in respect of such goods
shall be reduced to such an extent that the tax and
the surcharge together shall not exceed four per
centum of the sale or purchase price.”

Section 5(1)(b) of the Kerala General Sales Tax Act, 1963 reads as

under :

23
C.A.@S.L.P.(C)No.12859 of 2020 etc.

5. Levy of tax on sale or purchase of goods: - (1) Every
dealer (other than a casual trader or agent of a non-
resident dealer or the Central Government, or
Government of Kerala or the Government of any other
state or of any Union Territory, or any local authority)
whose total turnover for a year is not less than two lakhs
rupees and every casual trader or agent of a non-resident
dealer, the Central Government, Government of Kerala,
the Government of any other state or of any Union
Territory, or any local authority whatever be its total
turnover for the year in respect of goods included in the
Schedule at the rate mentioned against such goods,-

(a) ... 20. 0. eee

(b) in respect of Foreign liquor, at the point of sale by the
Kerala State Beverages (Manufacturing and Marketing)
Corporation Limited and at the point of first sale in the
State by a dealer liable to tax under this section except
where the sale is to the Kerala State Beverages
(Manufacturing and Marketing) Corporation Limited.

(ree

14.4. A reading of preamble and Section 3(1) of the KST Act, make it
abundantly clear that the surcharge on sales tax levied by the said Act
is nothing but an increase of the basic sales tax levied under Section
5(1) of the KGST Act, as such the surcharge is nothing but a sales tax.
It is also settled legal position that a surcharge on a tax is nothing but
the enhancement of the tax. In this regard, in support the said view,

ready reference can be made to the judgments of this Court in the case

24
C.A.@S.L.P.(C)No.12859 of 2020 etc.

of K. Srinivasan’ and Sarojini Tea Co. Ltd.*. Para 7 of the judgment

in the case of K. Srinivasan’ reads as under :

“7. The above legislative history of the Finance Acts, as
also the practice, would appear to indicate that the term
“Income tax” as employed in Section 2 includes sur-
charge as also the special and the additional surcharge
whenever provided which are also surcharges within the
meaning of Article 271 of the Constitution. The phraseol-
ogy employed in the Finance Acts of 1940 and 1941
showed that only the rates of income tax and supertax
were to be increased by a surcharge for the purpose of
the Central Government. In the Finance Act of 1958 the
language used showed that income tax which was to be
charged was to be increased by a surcharge for the pur-
pose of the Union. The word “surcharge” has thus been
used to either increase the rates of income tax and super
tax or to increase these taxes. The scheme of the Finance
Act of 1971 appears to leave no room for doubt that the
term “Income tax” as used in Section 2 includes sur-
charge.”

Para 20 of the judgment in the case of Sarojini Tea Co. Ltd.’ reads as

under :

“20. For the reasons aforesaid, we are unable to endorse
the view of the High Court that surcharge on land rev-
enue payable under the Surcharge Act is not land rev-
enue but a levy which is distinct from land revenue. In
consonance with the law laid down by this Court in Vish-
wesha Thirtha Swamiar case [(1972) 3 SCC 246 : (1972)
1 SCR 137: AIR 1971 SC 2377] it must be held that the
surcharge on land revenue levied under the Surcharge
Act, being an enhancement of the land revenue, is part of
the land revenue and has to be treated as such for the

25
C.A.@S.L.P.(C)No.12859 of 2020 etc.

purpose of assessing compensation under Section 12 of
the Ceiling Act.”
14.5. Further, CBDT itself has issued circular in Circular No.3/2018
which is issued, as a measure for reducing litigation, by revision of
monetary limits for filing appeals by the Department before the Income-
tax Appellate Tribunal, High Courts and SLP/appeals before this Court.
In the said circular it is clearly mentioned that for considering tax effect
it includes applicable surcharge and cess. Same will also strengthen
the stand of the assessee. Thus it is clear that the surcharge which is
sought to be levied is nothing but the enhancement of sales tax, which
is levied under Section 5(1) of the KGST Act. When the basic sales tax
paid by KSBC under Section 5(1)(b) of the KGST Act, deduction was
allowed, there is no reason not to allow deduction of surcharge on sales
tax. If the revenue does not consider Section 40(a)(iib) is applicable to
the basic sales tax paid by KSBC under Section 5(1)(b) of the KGST Act,
it is not known how the surcharge on sales tax, which is nothing but
the sales tax, can be brought in the net of Section 40O(a)(iib)(A) or 40(a)
(iib)(B) of the Act. Further a clear distinction between ‘fee’ and ‘tax’ is
carefully maintained throughout the scheme under Section 40O(a) of the
Act itself. Wherever the Parliament intended to cover the tax it

specifically mentioned as a tax. Section 40(a)(i) and 4O(a)(ia) specifically

26
C.A.@S.L.P.(C)No.12859 of 2020 etc.

relate to tax related items. Section 4O(a)(ic) refers to a sum paid on
account of fringe benefit tax. At the same time, Section 40(a)(iib) refers
to royalty, licence fee, service fee, privilege fee or any other fee or
charge. If these words are considered to include a tax or surcharge like
sales tax, the distinction so carefully spelt out in Section 40 between a
tax and a fee will be obliterated and rendered meaningless. It is settled
principle of interpretation that where the same Statute, uses different
terms and expressions, then it is clear that Legislature is referring to

distinct and different things. To support the said view ready reference
can be made to judgments of this Court in the case of DLF Qutab
Enclave Complex Educational Charitable Trust v. State of Haryana
& Ors.*; Kailash Nath Agarwal & Ors. v. Pradeshiya Industrial &
Investment Corporation of U.P. Ltd. & Anr.*; and Shri Ishar Alloy
Steels Ltd. v. Jayaswals Neco Ltd.°. The judgment relied on by the

learned ASG in the case of Jalkal Vibhag Nagar Nigam and Others*
would not render any assistance to support the case of the revenue.
The said judgment only considers whether the levy of water tax under
Section 52A of the U.P. Water Supply and Sewerage Act is a fee or
whether it is a tax covered by Entry 49 of List II of the seventh schedule

* (2003) 5 SCC 622
> (2003) 4 SCC 305
© (2001) 3 SCC 609

27
C.A.@S.L.P.(C)No.12859 of 2020 etc.

to the Constitution. The said judgment in fact maintains and does not
take away the basic constitutional distinction between ‘fee’ and ‘tax’.
Having regard to language used in Section 40(a)(iib), we are of the view
that the aforesaid judgment does not support the case of the revenue.
Even the other alternative submission of the learned counsel that it
may attract Section 4O(a)(iib)(B) also cannot be accepted for the reason
that wherever the Parliament intended to include tax, referred clearly to
taxes clearly in the very Section 40. That itself indicates that the
surcharge or tax were never intended to be included in the net of
amended Section 40O(a)(iib)(A) or 4O(a)(iib)(B) of the Income-tax Act,
1961.

15. So far as turnover tax is concerned it is submitted by the
learned ASG appearing for the revenue that such tax was imposed not
only on KSBC in terms of Section 5(1)(b) of KGST Act, but it is imposed
on various other retail dealers specified under Section 5(2) of the said
Act. Further turnover tax is also a tax. The very same reason which
we have assigned above for surcharge, equally apply to the turnover tax
also. As such turnover tax is also outside the purview of Section 40(a)
(iib)(A) and 40(a)(iib)(B).

16. For the aforesaid reasons, we hold that the gallonage fee,

licence fee and shop rental (kist) with respect to FL-9 and FL-1 licences

28
C.A.@S.L.P.(C)No.12859 of 2020 etc.

granted to the appellant will, squarely fall within the purview of Section
4O(a)(iib) of the Income-tax Act, 1961. The surcharge on sales tax and
turnover tax, is not a fee or charge coming within the scope of Section
AO(a)(iib)(A) or 40(a)(iib)(B), as such same is not an amount which can
be disallowed under the said provision and disallowance made in this
regard is rightly set aside by the High Court.

17. Accordingly, the civil appeal filed by the assessee is dismissed
and the civil appeals filed by the revenue are partly allowed to the
extent indicated above. In result, the assessments completed against
the assessee with respect to assessment years 2014-2015 and 2015-
2016 stand set aside. The assessing officer to pass revised orders after
computing the liability in accordance with the directions as indicated
above. As the dispute relates to assessment years 2014-2015 and
2015-2016, the assessing officer shall pass appropriate orders, within a
period of two months from the date of receipt of this judgment.

REPORTABLE

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION
CIVIL APPEAL NO.7403 OF 2021

Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation ..Appellant (S)

Versus

Dilip Uttam Jayabhay ..Respondent (S)

JUDGMENT

M. R. Shah, J.

1. Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned
judgment and order dated 23.01.2020 passed by the High
Court of Judicature at Bombay in Writ Petition No.8401 of
2003, by which the High Court has dismissed the said writ
petition preferred by the appellant — Maharashtra State

con Road Transport Corporation (hereinafter referred to as

“MSRTC”) in which it challenged the order passed by the
Industrial Court in Revision Application (ULP) No.13 of
2002, directing reinstatement of respondent without back
wages but with the continuity of service, original writ

petitioner - MSRTC has preferred the present appeal.

The respondent herein was serving as a driver and plying
passenger buses. That on 23.10.1992 when he was driving
the bus, it met with an accident with a jeep coming from
the opposite direction. It appears that instead of taking the
bus to the left side, he took the bus to the extreme right
which was the wrong side and as a result, the jeep and the
bus collided. The accident resulted in death of four
passengers on the spot and six passengers were seriously
injured. The jeep was completely damaged with its radiator
and engine board broken and damaged and the inside of
the jeep was completely crushed. The impact of the
collision was so high that the jeep was pushed back by
about 25 feet. The bumper of the bus was also crushed.
The driver of the jeep also sustained injuries. The
respondent was subjected to disciplinary enquiry. On

conclusion of enquiry he was dismissed from service. He
was also prosecuted for the offence under Section 279 of
IPC. However, he came to be acquitted. (his acquittal shall
be dealt with herein below). The respondent challenged the
order of dismissal before the Labour Court. The Labour
Court upheld the order of dismissal. In a _ revision
application the Industrial Tribunal considering the
acquittal of the respondent in criminal proceedings and
observing that the drivers of both the vehicles were
negligent (contributory negligence), the Industrial Tribunal
exercised powers under item No.1(g) of Schedule-IV of the
Maharashtra Recognition of Trade Unions and Prevention
of Unfair Labour Practices Act, 1971. (““MRTU” and “PULP
Act, 1971” for short), and held that the order of dismissal
is disproportionate to the misconduct proved. Before the
Industrial Tribunal the respondent/workman did not press
for the back wages. The Industrial Tribunal directed his
reinstatement without back wages but with continuity of

Service.

Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the order dated

31.07.2003 passed by the Industrial Tribunal ordering
reinstatement without back wages but with continuity of
service, the appellant preferred writ petition before the
High Court. By the impugned judgment and order the High
Court has not only dismissed the writ petition preferred by
the appellant, but has also directed appellant to pay to the
respondent back wages with effect from 01.11.2003 to
31.05.2018 i.e. which is the date of his superannuation.
The High Court has also directed that the respondent shall
also be entitled to retiral benefits on the basis of continuity
of service with effect from date of his dismissal and till his

superannuation.

Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned
judgment and order passed by the High Court, dismissing
the writ petition and confirming the order passed by the
Industrial Tribunal setting aside the order of dismissal and
ordering reinstatement with continuity of service and back

wages, the MSRTC has preferred the present appeal.

Ms. Mayuri Raghuvanshi, learned counsel appearing on

behalf of the appellant - MSRTC has vehemently submitted
5.1

9.2

that in the facts and circumstances of the case, the
Industrial Court committed a grave error in interfering with
the order of dismissal passed by the disciplinary authority
on the ground that the same is shockingly disproportionate

to the misconduct proved.

It is submitted that both, the High Court as well as the
Industrial Court have not at all considered and/or
appreciated the difference between the disciplinary enquiry

and the criminal proceedings.

It is submitted that the High Court as well as the Industrial
Court had erred in relying upon the acquittal of respondent
in criminal case. It is submitted that the Industrial Court
and the High Court have failed to appreciate that the
acquittal has no bearing or relevance on the disciplinary
proceedings as the standard of proof in both the cases are
different and the proceedings operate in different fields and
have different objectives. Reliance is placed on _ the

decisions of this Court in cases of Samar Bahadur Singh

Vs. State of U.P. & Ors., (2011) 9 SCC 94 and Union of
9.3

53.4

India & Ors. Vs. Sitaram Mishra & Anr., (2019) 20 SCC

588.

It is further submitted that in fact the Labour Court rightly
held that acquittal in the criminal case would not come to
the rescue of the respondent as the acquittal in the
criminal case is on the failure of the prosecution to
examine investigating officer, panch for spot panchnama,
etc., and to prove their case beyond doubt. It is submitted
that on the other hand in the departmental proceedings
misconduct has been proved. It is therefore submitted that
the Industrial Court and the High Court ought not to have
given undue importance to the acquittal of the respondent

in the criminal case.

It is further submitted that even otherwise in the facts and
circumstances of the case when in the vehicle accident four
persons died due to the negligence on the part of the
respondent in driving the vehicle carelessly and negligently
and during his three years’ tenure he was punished four

times earlier, it cannot be said that the punishment of
5.9

dismissal was shockingly disproportionate. It is submitted
that in the facts and circumstances of the case, the case
would not fall under item No.1(g) of Schedule-IV of the

MRTU and PULP Act, 1971.

It is further submitted that even the Industrial Court
specifically observed in the order that the misconduct is
not of a minor or technical character. It is further
submitted that the Industrial Court also observed that
there is no victimization and the action of the MSRTC
cannot be said to be not in good faith. The Industrial Court
also observed that the MSRTC has neither falsely
implicated the complainant - respondent nor has it
dismissed the respondent for patently false reasons and
therefore respondent failed to prove the alleged unfair
labour practice as per the MRTU and PULP Act, 1971. It is
submitted that however the Industrial Court has interfered
with the order of punishment/dismissal imposed by the
disciplinary authority invoking clause 1(g) of Schedule-IV of

MRTU and PULP Act, 1971.
5.6

5.7

It is further submitted that even the respondent admitted
that he was gainfully employed after his dismissal.
Therefore, the order of reinstatement was not warranted at

all.

It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing on
behalf of the appellant that even otherwise the directions
issued by the High Court in the impugned judgment and
order in para 8 directing the appellant - MSRTC to pay to
the respondent back wages with effect from 1** November,
2003 to 31*' May, 2018, could not have been passed in a
petition filed by the appellant —- MSRTC. It is submitted
therefore that such an order is as such beyond the scope of

the writ petition before the High Court.

Making the above submissions, it is prayed to allow the

present appeal.

Shri Nishanth Patil, learned counsel appearing on behalf of
the respondent has supported the judgment and order
passed by the Industrial Court and confirmed by the High

Court.
7.1

7.2

It is submitted that in the facts and circumstances of the
case when the Industrial Court found the order of
dismissal disproportionate to the misconduct proved, the
same can be said to be an unfair labour practice as per
item No. 1(g) of Schedule-IV of the MRTU & PULP Act,
1971. Thus the Industrial Court rightly interfered with the
order of dismissal and the same is rightly confirmed by the

High Court.

It is contended that in the present case as such it was not
the fault on the part of the respondent - driver. That the
jeep driver coming from the opposite side was on the wrong
side of the road and the respondent tried to avoid the
accident. It is submitted that the criminal court found that
even the jeep driver was also negligent and considering the
fact the criminal court acquitted the respondent - driver,
the judgment and order passed by the Industrial Court,
ordering reinstatement without back wages but with
continuity of service does not warrant any interference. It

is submitted therefore that the High Court rightly did not
10.

interfere with the judgment and order passed by the
Industrial Court ordering reinstatement without back

wages.

Making the above submissions, it is prayed to dismiss the

present appeal.

We have heard the learned counsel appearing on behalf of

the respective parties at length.

At the outset, it is required to be noted that in the
departmental proceedings the misconduct alleged against
the respondent —- driver of driving the vehicle rashly and
negligently due to which the accident occurred in which
four persons died has been proved. Thereafter, the
disciplinary authority passed an order of dismissal,
dismissing the respondent — workman from service. The
Labour Court did not interfere with the order of dismissal
by giving cogent reasons and after re-appreciating the
entire evidence on record including the order of acquittal
passed by the criminal court. However, the Industrial

Court though did not interfere with the findings recorded

10
by the disciplinary authority on the misconduct proved,
interfered with the order of dismissal solely on the ground
that punishment of dismissal is disproportionate to the
misconduct proved and the same can be said to be to be
unfair labour practice as per item No. 1(g) of Schedule-IV of
the MRTU & PULP Act, 1971. The same is not interfered

with by the High Court.

10.1 Therefore, the short question which is posed for the

10.2

consideration of this Court is whether in the facts and
circumstances of the case the punishment of dismissal can
be said to be an unfair labour practice on the ground that
the same was disproportionate to the misconduct proved
and therefore the Industrial Court was justified in
interfering with the order of dismissal and ordering

reinstatement with continuity of service.

Having gone through the findings recorded by the enquiry
officer in the departmental enquiry and the judgment and
order passed by the labour court as well as the Industrial
Court and even the judgment and order of acquittal passed

by the criminal court, it emerges that when the respondent

11
was driving the vehicle it met with an accident with the
jeep coming from the opposite side and in the said accident
four persons died. From the material on record it emerges
that the impact of the accident with the jeep coming from
the opposite side was such that the jeep was pushed back
25 feet. From the aforesaid facts it can be said that the
respondent — workman was driving the vehicle in such a
great speed and rashly due to which the accident had
occurred in which four persons died. Even while acquitting
the accused — respondent — driver who was facing the trial
under Sections 279 and 304(a) of IPC Criminal Court
observed that the prosecution failed to prove that the
incident occurred due to rash and negligent driving of the
accused — respondent herein only and none else. Therefore,
at the best even if it is assumed that even driver of the jeep
was also negligent, it can be said to be a case of
contributory negligence. That does not mean that the
respondent — workman was not at all negligent. Hence, it

does not absolve him of the misconduct.

12
10.3

10.4

Much stress has been given by the Industrial Court on the
acquittal of the respondent by the criminal court. However,
as such the Labour Court had in extenso considered the
order of acquittal passed by the criminal court and did not
agree with the submissions made on behalf of the
respondent — workman that as he was acquitted by the
criminal court he cannot be held guilty in the disciplinary

proceedings.

Even from the judgment and order passed by the criminal
court it appears that the criminal court acquitted the
respondent based on the hostility of the witnesses; the
evidence led by the interested witnesses; lacuna in
examination of the investigating officer; panch for the spot
panchnama of the incident, etc. Therefore, criminal court
held that the prosecution has failed to prove the case
against the respondent beyond reasonable doubt. On the
contrary in the departmental proceedings the misconduct
of driving the vehicle rashly and negligently which caused
accident and due to which four persons died has been

established and proved. As per the cardinal principle of law

13
10.5

an acquittal in a criminal trial has no bearing or relevance
on the disciplinary proceedings as the standard of proof in
both the cases are different and the proceedings operate in
different fields and with different objectives. Therefore, the
Industrial Court has erred in giving much stress on the
acquittal of the respondent by the criminal court. Even
otherwise it is required to be noted that the Industrial
Court has not interfered with the findings recorded by the
disciplinary authority holding charge and misconduct
proved in the departmental enquiry, and has interfered
with the punishment of dismissal solely on the ground that
same is shockingly disproportionate and therefore can be
said to be an unfair labour practice as per clause No. 1(g) of

Schedule-IV of the MRTU & PULP Act, 1971.

Now so far as the order passed by the Industrial Court
ordering reinstatement with continuity of service by
invoking clause No.1(g) of Schedule-IV of the MRTU &
PULP Act, 1971 is concerned, as per clause No. 1(g) only in
a case where it is found that dismissal of an employee is

for misconduct of a minor or technical character, without

14
having any regard to the nature of the particular
misconduct or the past record of service of the employee,
so as to amount to a_ shockingly disproportionate
punishment. Clause No.1 of Schedule-IV of the MRTU &
PULP Act, 1971 reads as under:-

“Schedule IV
1. To discharge or dismiss employees-

(a) by way of victimisation;

(b) not in good faith, but in the colourable exercise
of the employer’s rights;

(c) by falsely implicating an employee in a criminal
case on false evidence or on concocted evidence;

(d) for patently false reasons;

(e) on untrue or trumped up allegations of absence
without leave;

(f) in utter disregard of the principles of natural
justice in the conduct of domestic enquiry or
with undue haste;

(g) for misconduct of a minor or _ technical
character, without having any regard to the
nature of the particular misconduct or the past
record of service of the employee, so as to

amount to a_ shockingly disproportionate
punishment.”

Applying clause No.1(g) of Schedule-IV of the MRTU &
PULP Act, 1971, to the present case it cannot be said that
the dismissal of the respondent was for misconduct of a

minor or technical character, without having any regard to

15
11.

the nature of the misconduct. The respondent —- workman
has been held to be guilty for a particular charge and
particular misconduct. Even the past record of service of
the respondent has not been considered by the Industrial
Court. AS per case of the appellant - MSRTC the
respondent — workman was in service for three years and
during three years’ service tenure he was punished four
times. Therefore, it cannot be said that the order of
dismissal was without having any regard to the past record
of the service of the respondent. Therefore, in the facts and
circumstances of the case, the Industrial Court wrongly
invoked clause No.1(g) of Schedule-IV of the MRTU & PULP

Act, 1971.

Even otherwise in the facts of the case when in the
departmental enquiry, it has been specifically found that
due to rash and negligent driving on the part of the driver —
respondent, the accident took place in which four persons
died, when the punishment of dismissal is imposed it
cannot be said to be’ shockingly disproportionate

punishment. In the departmental proceedings every aspect

16
12.

13.

has been considered. At the cost of repetition, it is observed
that even the Industrial Court has not interfered with the
findings recorded by the enquiry officer in the
departmental proceedings. Therefore, in the facts and
circumstance of the case, the Industrial Court committed a
grave error and has exceeded in its jurisdiction while
interfering with the order of dismissal passed by the
disciplinary authority, which was not interfered by the

Labour Court.

It is also required to be noted that before the Industrial
Court the respondent —- workman - driver admitted that
after the order of dismissal he has been gainfully employed.
Therefore also the reinstatement in service with continuity

of service was not warranted.

Even the directions issued by the High Court in para 8 in
the impugned judgment and order directing the appellant
to pay wages to the respondent — workman for the period
from 01.11.2003 to 31.05.2018 also could not have been
passed by the High Court in a writ petition filed by the
appellant. It was not the petition filed by the workman —

17
respondent. Therefore, even otherwise the directions issued
in para 8 of the impugned judgment and order cannot be
sustained as the same is beyond the scope and ambit of

the controversy before the High Court.

14. In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, the
present Appeal Succeeds. The judgment and order passed
by the Industrial Court in Revision Application (ULP) No.13
of 2002 and the impugned judgment and order passed by
the High Court in Writ Petition No.8401 of 2003 are hereby
quashed and set aside and the judgment and Award
passed by the Labour Court in Complaint (ULP) No.96 of
1993 is hereby ordered to be restored. Consequently, the
order of dismissal passed by the disciplinary authority
dismissing the respondent —- workman from service is
hereby upheld. The present appeal is allowed to the

aforesaid extent. There shall be no order as to costs.

CIVIL APPEAL NO. 9 OF 2022
(Arising out of SLP(C) No.2876 of 2021)

JUDGMENT

Page 1 of 52
Hrishikesh Roy, J.

Leave granted.
2. The challenge in these appeals is to the judgment
and order dated 25.11.2019 of the Division Bench of the
High Court of Calcutta, whereby the decision of the
Single Judge dismissing the suit 1.e. CS No. 79/2006 of
M/s. SIBCO Investment Pvt Ltd (for short SIBCO) was
reversed. The suit was filed against Small Industries
Development Bank of India (SIDBI) seeking interest on
the alleged belated payment of principal sum _ and
accrued interest to the plaintiff for the Bonds issued

by SIDBI.

3. The question to be answered in this case is whether
plaintiff has set forth a just claim, based on the
Bonds issued by the defendant or is it a case of that
trial in Shakespeare’s The Merchant of Venice where
Shylock 1s claiming the promised pound of flesh in the
form of interest on delayed payment on the _ Bonds
purchased by the plaintiff. The 41 Bonds related to
this case were initially issued by SIDBI to M/s. CRB

Page 2 of 52
Capital Markets Ltd. (Hereinafter referred to as “CRB
Capital”) in 1993. Those Bonds were then sold by CRB
Capital to one Shankar Lal Saraf in February, 1997 and
those in turn were then sold on 1.7.1998 to SIBCO - the
plaintiff and the respondent herein. In the meantime,
CRB Capital faced winding up proceedings at_ the
instance of the RBI in the Delhi High Court. The said

proceeding will have a bearing on this case.

4. The following relevant facts necessary _ for
consideration of this appeal are broadly culled out

from the judgment of the Calcutta High Court: -

4.1 The Plaintiff SIBCO purchased the Bonds in the
form of promissory notes issued by the defendant SIDBI.
These are termed as SIDBI Bonds 2003 (4th Series)
carrying 13.50% interest and SIDBI Bonds 2004 (5th
Series) generating interest at the rate of 12.50%, from
one Shankar Lal Saraf on ist July, 1998. The interest
is payable on a half-yearly basis on/or before 21° day
of June and 21° day of December of every year. The 5th
series Bonds were agreed to be redeemed on 21°

December, 2004 whereas the 4th series Bonds were to be

Page 3 of 52
redeemed on 21st December, 2003. The Bonds are freely
tradable in the market. M/s. SIBCO purchased 15 Bonds
(interest payable @ 13.50%) and 26 Bonds (interest
payable @12.50%) of face value of ten lakhs each for an
aggregate price of Rs. 3.69 crores on ist July, 1998 by
M/s. SIBCO from the said Shankar Lal Saraf. The Bonds
were deposited with M/s. SIDBI (defendant) on July 2,
1998 with the request to endorse the name of the
Plaintiff-purchaser on the said Bonds. On refusal to
register and/or record the name of the SIBCO by the
defendant on the ground that CRB Capital had gone into
involuntary liquidation proceedings at the instance of
the RBI. At first the Plaintiff filed the W.P. No.
1456 of 1998 before the Calcutta High Court seeking a
mandamus upon defendant to transfer the aforesaid Bonds
in favour of the plaintiff and also to pay the interest

accrued on them.

4.2 The Calcutta High Court on 09.01.2001 held that
writ court is not the proper forum and permitted the
petitioner to approach the Company Court, being the
High Court at Delhi, seeking intervention in the

Page 4 of 52
liquidation proceeding initiated against CRB Capital.
Though an intra-court appeal was preferred against the
Said order but it was not proceeded with. On the
request of the plaintiff, the Shankar Lal Saraf (the
plaintiff’s predecessor-in-interest ) filed an
interlocutory application in the pending liquidation
proceeding before the Company-Court, claiming that the
aforesaid transactions should be treated as outside the
purview of the Jliquidation proceeding, under_ the

Companies Act, 1956.

4.3 By a judgment dated 17th December, 2004, the
Learned Company Court held that the subject Bonds are
beyond the purview of the liquidation proceeding and
directed Shankar Lal Saraf to put up the matter before
the defendant. On 17th February, 2005 the above
judgment of the Company Court was communicated and the
Bonds were presented to the defendant. Then on 21st
February, 2005 the defendant made the payment of the
principal amount together with the interest calculated
up to the date, aS promised in the said Bond to M/s
SIBCO with TDS deduction at around 20%. By a letter

Page 5 of 52
dated 24th February, 2005, the Plaintiff raised an
objection over the rate on which the TDS was deducted,
which was accepted by the defendant as it issued a
further warrant covering a sum of Rs. 58,86,833/- on

account of excess TDS deductions.

4.4 The case projected in the plaint in the CS No.
79/2006, was that the defendant during their audit
detected that the interest was calculated up to 31st
October, 2005 and demand was raised on account of
interest on delayed payment of the principal amount and
the interest on Bonds through a letter dated November
10, 2005. The defendant refused to accede to the
demand made by the plaintiff in its reply letter dated
November 23, 2005. Aggrieved by the refusal, M/s SIBCO
filed the CS No. 79/2006 for a sum of Rs. 3,25,54, 483/-

From M/s SIDBI.

4.5 The defendant disputed the claim on account of
delayed payment or in other words, delayed redemption
of the aforesaid Bonds. It was categorically pleaded
that a liquidation proceeding was initiated against CRB

Capital, who at one point of time was the holder of the

Page 6 of 52
aforesaid Bonds and sold it to the said Shankar Lal
Saraf on February 20, 1997 and on April 7, 1997. The
RBI issued a facsimile dated June 9, 1997 advising the
defendant not to affect any transfer, register any lien
or otherwise deal with such security invested by CRB
Capital and its Group Companies, without’ prior
permission of the Official Liquidator appointed by the
Company Court at Delhi. Since Shankar Lal Saraf as
well as the plaintiff were pressing hard for enfacing
their name on the said Bonds, a clarification was
sought on December 23, 1997 by the defendant from the
RBI seeking advice for further action in the matter on
January 29, 1998. The RBI advised the defendant to
take up the matter with the Official Liquidator which

was accordingly done on April 3, 1998.

4.6 The defendant stated that despite multiple
reminders till July 18, 2001 no reply was received from
the Official Liguidator in this regard. The specific
Stand is that due to the embargo imposed by RBI, the
defendant couldn’t act in defiance of the RBI’s
directions. It is further stated that because of the

Page 7 of 52
pendency of the writ petition before the Calcutta High
Court, the matter was not taken up and, therefore,
neither the interest nor the redemption was paid.
According to the defendant, after the Company Court
order in the liquidation proceeding, the plaintiff’s
name was put down upon the said Bonds and the holder
was paid the principal, as well as the interest up to
the date of redemption. As such there is no latches,
negligence and delay on the part of the defendant to

honour the Bonds to the plaintiff.

4.7 The central case projected by the plaintiff was
that the amount, both principal and interest, were paid
beyond the maturity period and, therefore, the
defendant is liable to pay the interest for delayed
payment. According to the plaintiff, the defendant has
unreasonably withheld the said amount, whereas, the
defendant says that because of the embargo-= and
restriction by the RBI and the pending proceedings, the
maturity amount was not paid on the date of maturity.

The reliance appeared to have been placed by both the

Page 8 of 52
Sides on the facsimile dated 9°" June, 1997 issued by

the RBI.

I. TRIAL COURT FINDINGS

5. The learned Trial Judge in his judgment noted that
there is a clear stipulation against affecting any
transfer, register any lien or otherwise deal with, the
securities of CRB Capital with further stipulation that
it should not part with the interest, dividend or
principal without the permission of the Official
Liquidator. Additionally it appears from the_- order
passed by the Company Court that there was a
notification issued on 10° April 1997 under Section 45-
MB of the RBI (Amendment) Act, 1997 directing the said
Company not to sell, transfer, create charge or
mortgage or deal in any manner with any of its profits
and assets without the permission of the RBI for a
period of six months from the date of the said
notification. The Official Liquidator was appointed on
22. May, 1997 who subsequently treated the subject

Bonds as fraudulent preference under Section 531 of the

Page 9 of 52
Companies Act, 1956. Though it was held by the Company
Court vide its judgment dated 17.12.2004, that the
transactions are genuine and cannot be declared as
fraudulent preference at the instance of the Official
Liquidator, the fact remains that there was some claim

over the subject Bonds.

5.1 The RBI is found to be empowered to control the
management of the Banking Company in certain situations
and can lay down the parameters enabling Banking
Companies to expand business and regulate the paid up
capital, reserve funds, cash funds and above all
policies in the matter of advances to be made by the
Banking Companies and allocation of resources etc. The
RBI is authorized by the Parliament to enact the policy
and to issue directions/guidelines which have statutory
force, as held in case of ICICI Bank Ltd. Vs. Official
Liquidator of APS Star Industries Ltd.* In support for
the aforesaid proposition, the Trial Court also relied
on the ratio in Sudhir Shantilal Mehta Vs. Central

Bureau of India* to comment on the Regulatory role of

1(2010) 10 SCC 1.
2(1992)2 SCC 343.
Page 10 of 52
the RBI vis-a-vis the business of the - banking

companies.

5.2 This suggests that once the RBI has issued
directions, any action contrary thereto, may not only
attract the civil liability but might also invite
Criminal breach of trust. According to the Trial Court
the defendant was not sitting in slumber’ after
receiving the RBI instructions but sought advice
immediately thereafter and was directed to approach the
Official Liquidator. The defendants sought
Clarification from the Official Liquidator but did not
receive any reply. Ultimately on 17‘ December, 2004,
the application of Shankar Lal Saraf before the
Company-Court succeeded and within a_ short span _ of
time, the redemption value along with interest was paid
to the plaintiff. The Learned Trial Judge did not
agree with the submission of the plaintiff that there
was any deliberate attempt to delay the payment of the
maturity amount by the defendant. It would be worth

noting that the Trial Court relied on defendants’

Page 11 of 52
witness to hold that the accrued interest’ was
transferred to the accrued interest head and,
therefore, it was not utilized nor any benefit was

taken therefrom.

5.3 AS can be seen, the Suit was dismissed primarily on
two grounds: -

(A) The bonds in question could not be transferred
by the petitioner since the RBI had initiated winding
up proceedings against CRB Capital before the Delhi
High Court, whereafter the RBI has issued a directive
dated 9.6.1997 to the petitioner herein directing not
to register transfer of CRB Capital’s Bonds’ in
question, or to part with any payment pertaining to the
Said Bonds, without consent of the Official Liquidator.
The learned Judge therefore found that the petitioner
had acted entirely in accordance with the directive of
the RBI, by requesting permission from the Official
Liquidator, and thereby promptly making the payment of
the amounts due under the Bonds after appropriate

orders were passed by the Delhi High Court where

Page 12 of 52
winding up proceedings were going on. Hence, the
defendant could not be held liable for the delayed
payment.

(B) The learned Trial Judge also noted the conduct
of the plaintiff, in accepting the payment under the
Bonds, including interest, without any protest in
February, 2005. The plaintiff thereafter slept over
this issue for almost 8 months, and for the first time
Claimed interest for the delayed payment in October
2005. The court therefore found that since the
plaintiff had accepted the encashment without protest
the law laid down by this Court in Bhagwati Prasad
Pawan Kumar v. Union of India? would apply, since there
was acceptance by conduct. In Bhagwati Prasad (supra),

the Court has held: -

“19. It is well settled that an offer may
accepted by conduct. But conduct would only
amount to acceptance if it is clear that the
offeree did the act with the intention
(actual or apparent) of accepting the offer.
The decision which we have noticed above also
proceed on this principle. Each case _ must
rest on its own facts. The courts examine
the evidence to find out whether in the fact
and circumstances of the case the conduct of

3(2006) 5 SCC 311.
Page 13 of 52
the “offeree” was such an amounted to an

unequivocal acceptance of the offer made. If

the facts of the case disclose that there was

no reservation in signifying acceptance by

conduct. On the other hand, if the evidence

discloses that the “offeree” had reservation

in accepting the offer, his conduct may not

amount to acceptance of the offer in terms of

Section 8 of the Contract Act.”
IIT. APPELLATE COURT PROCEEDINGS:
6. Aggrieved by the order of the learned Trial Judge
of the Calcutta High Court, the plaintiff preferred an
intra-court appeal which was numbered as APD 291/2015.
On 25t° November 2019, The Learned Division Bench,
allowed the plaintiff’s appeal, and set-aside _ the
judgment favoring the defendant. The High Court
observed in the appeal that, even after the RBI
communication dated 09° June 1997, the defendant had
paid interest accruing in June, 1997 to the plaintiff’s
predecessor-in-interest, Shankar Lal Saraf. The court
relied on a letter issued by the defendant to RBI dated
23° December 1997, wherein the defendant had admitted
that it was impossible to withhold payment’ forever.

Based on these observations, the learned Division bench

held that the RBI communication dated 09 June, 1997

Page 14 of 52
was merely a suggestion to the defendant and not an
order passed by the RBI exercising its’~ statutory
authority. Hence, the defendant was without a
reasonable cause, when it chose to withheld payment

duly accrued to the respondent.

6.1 It was accordingly held that the suit was not
barred either by accord or _ satisfaction as_ the
plaintiff gave no acknowledgment that all claims stood
satisfied at the time of receiving the payment warrants
on 21% February 2005. Hence, the plaintiff was at
liberty to raise further demands including demand for
interest on delayed payment. The Learned Division
Bench further held that reliance on Bhagwati Prasad
(Supra) by the trial judge was misplaced as it was not
cited by either parties and was relied on without
giving the parties a chance to rebut it. The defendant
was accordingly directed to pay simple interest @ 6%
per annum on interest, from date of accrual and 8%
Simple interest per annum on principal amount from date

of maturity of respective Bonds by 29.02.2020.

Page 15 of 52
III. DISCUSSION AND DECISION:

7. #The present appeals are filed impugning the above
judgment of the Division Bench of the Calcutta High
Court. The defendant seeks relief of setting aside the
judgment of the Division Bench in toto. Whereas, the
plaintiff seeks pendente lite interest over and above
the interest already awarded, and is disputing the rate
of interest awarded by the Learned Division bench on

interest and Principal amount.

7.1 Assailing the legality of the judgment of the
appellate Bench of the Calcutta High Court, Mr K V
Viswanathan, learned Senior Counsel for the defendant
makes the following arguments: -
(1) SIDBI acted entirely in accordance
with the directives issued by the
RBI, as any prudent financial

institution would;

Page 16 of 52
(11)Withholding of payment under’ the
Bonds in question, was justified in
light of possibility of transfer of
the Bonds by CRB Capital being a
Fraudulent Preference under S. 531

of the Companies Act, 1956;

(111) SIBCO bought the bonds in question
in “suspect spell’ with the
Knowledge that two installments of
interest had accrued and not been
paid; not established that he is a
“holder in due course”; there is a

cloud on its title;

(iv)Petitioner acted proactively by
preferring numerous letters to
RBI/Official Liquidator; amounts
cannot be said to have been

wrongfully withheld;

Page 17 of 52
(v) Neither Saraf nor  SIBCO claimed
interest for delayed payment’ of
interest or the maturity amounts
under the Bonds in previous
litigation; barred by constructive

res judicata;

(vi) The payments made were accepted by
Respondent without protest and

amount to accord and satisfaction;

(vil) The Respondent/SIBCO’s claim _ for
interest pendente lite is a clear
after-thought, and in any event, not

justified;

7.2 Per contra, Mr. Sabyasachi Chaudhury, learned
Senior Counsel representing the plaintiff (respondent )

contends that:

(1) The RBI merely issued an advice

which pertained to assets held by

Page 18 of 52
(11)

(iii)

(1v)

CRB Capital and was inapplicable to
the Bonds in question, which were
owned by plaintiff when the advice

was issued;

SIDBI’s action of withholding
payment, on apprehension of
fraudulent preference by M/s. CRB
Capital was not bona _ fide, in
absence of any objection by _ the

Official Liquidator;

SIDBI is barred by res
judicata from arguing’ fraudulent
preference, as this issue is
settled by the judgment of Company

Court dated 17‘" December, 2004;

The payment was made in furtherance
of promissory notes, which are
unconditional undertakings, and not

in pursuance of any~ reciprocal
Page 19 of 52
promise. Thus, the issue of
‘accord and satisfaction’ doesn’t

arise;

(v) Plaintiff has claimed = interest
pendente lite consistently at

trial, as well as appellate level.

IV. RBI’s 09.06.1997 COMMUNICATION- ‘ADVICE’ OR

‘DIRECTIVE’ :

8. In order to ascertain the effect of the _ RBI
Communication on the Bonds in question, it will be
beneficial to examine the statutory provisions which
empower the _ RBI. For efficient discharge of its
functions, the RBI has been granted special powers for
controlling and regulating various financial
institutions, as is clear from different provisions of
The RBI Act, 1934 and The Banking Regulation Act, 1949.
As per the RBI Act, 1934, we find that the RBI has wide
Supervisory jurisdiction over all Banking Institutions

in the country. This court speaking through Justice V.

Page 20 of 52
Ramasubramaniyan, in the case of Internet and Mobile
Association of India vs. RBI*, elucidated on the
position of the RBI as a statutory body, with immense

power in financial/ monetary field:

“190. But given the scheme of the
RBI Act, 1934 and the Banking
Regulation Act, 1949, the above
argument appears only to belittle
the role of RBI. RBI is not just
like any other statutory body
created by an Act of legislature.
It is a creature, created with a
mandate to get liberated even from
its creator..Therefore, RBI cannot
be equated to any other statutory
body that merely serves its master.
It is specifically empowered to do
certain things to the exclusion of
even the Central Government.
Therefore, to place its decisions
at a pedestal lower than that of
even an executive decision, would
do violence to the scheme of the
Act. ”

8.1 Through Chapter IIIB of The RBI Act, 1934, the RBI
1S empowered to regulate and also monitor the conduct
of every Non-Banking Financial Institutions (NBFC) in
India. Under S. 45-JA of the RBI Act, 1934, the RBI is

empowered, in public interest or to protect’ the

4 (2020) 10 SCC 274.
Page 21 of 52
interests of the depositors or to regulate the
financial system of the country, to determine the
policy and issue directions to NBFCs. S. 45-kK grants
authority to the RBI to collect information pertaining
to the NBFCS and to give directions pertaining to
deposits to _ them. Whereas, under S. 45-L, general
powers are conferred on the RBI to call for information
from the Financial Institution and issue directions to
regulate the credit system of the country. S. 45-M of
the RBI Act, 1934 casts an obligation upon the NBFCs,
to furnish all information and details as required by
the RBI and to comply with RBI’s direction given under

Chapter IIIB of the RBI Act.

8.2 Similar powers are granted to the RBI in respect of
Banks under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. In the
case at hand, we are concerned with S. 35-A of the
Banking Regulation Act, 1949 which enables the RBI to

give directions to banking companies: -

“35A. Power of the Reserve Bank to
give directions:

(1) Where the Reserve Bank is
satisfied that-

Page 22 of 52
(a) in the public interest; or

(aa) in the interest of banking
policy; or

(b) to prevent the affairs of any
banking company being conducted in
a manner detrimental to the
interests of the depositors or in
a manner prejudicial to the
interests of the banking company;
or

(c) to secure the proper
management of any banking company
generally, it 1S necessary’ to
issue directions to banking
companies generally or to any
banking company in particular, it
may, from time to time, issue such
directions as it deems fit, and
the banking companies’ or _ the
banking company, as the case may
be, shall be bound to comply with
such directions.”

8.3 The Section S. 45-MB of the RBI Act, 1934 being
relevant in the above context which empowers the RBI,
to inter alia prohibit the acceptance of deposit and
alienation of assets by  Non-Banking Financial
Companies, when they fail to comply with RBIs

direction or infringe any statutory provisions, is

extracted for ready reference as under:

Page 23 of 52
8.4 At this juncture,

exact

“45MB. Power of Bank to prohibit
acceptance of deposit and alienation
of assets:

(1) If any non-banking financial
company violates the provisions of
any section or fails to comply with
any direction or order given by the
Bank under any of the provisions of
this Chapter, the Bank may prohibit
the non-banking financial company
from accepting any deposit.

(2) Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in any agreement
or instrument or any law for the
time being in force, the Bank, on
being satisfied that it 1S necessary
so to do in the public interest or
in the interest of the depositors,
may direct, the non-banking
financial company against which an
order prohibiting from accepting
deposit has been issued, not to
sell, transfer, create charge or
mortgage or deal in any manner with
its property and assets’~ without
prior written permission of the Bank
for such period not exceeding six
months from the date of the order.”

wordings of the RBI communication

09.06.1997 addressed to the defendant:

“We understand that M/s.
Markets Ltd.

Page 24 of 52

CRB Capital
and its associates have
invested in the shares/bonds/other

securities of your institution. As you

it is pertinent to extract the

dated
are aware, RBI has filed a petition for

the winding up of the said company in

the High Court, Delhi. We, therefore,

advise you not to effect any transfer,

register any lien, or otherwise deal

with such securities and also not _ to

part with the interest/dividends’~ or

principal without the permission of the

Official Liquidator, appointed by _ the

High Court of Delhi. Please confirm and

advise the amount of investments so held

by the company/companies with your

institution.”
8.5 As 1S apparent from above, the RBI in its
communication has informed SIBCO of the winding up
proceedings initiated against CRB Capital and
categorically prohibited the defendant from, inter
alia, parting with the interest on _- securities.
However, the RBI has not mentioned any provision under
which the above-mentioned communication was issued.
This has encouraged the Learned Counsel for_ the

plaintiff to argue that it is merely an ‘advice’ from

RBI, and not a statutorily enforceable directive.

8.6 In the case at hand, vide the previous
Notification dated 10.04.1997, the RBI restrained CRB
Capital (an NBFC), from alienating or creating charge

over their assets in ‘public interest”, and through the
Page 25 of 52
consequential directive dated 09.06.1997 has restrained
the defendant from parting with any money in relation
to securities held by the said NBFC. Even though, on
the date of the- prohibitory Notification dated
10.04.1997, the Bonds were in Shankar Lal Saraf’s
Ownership, and not held by CRB Capital, the
Notification and subsequent directive dated 09.06.1997
was still applicable as there was a clear shadow over

the Shankar Lal Saraf’s title.

8.7 A conjoint reading of the statutory provisions
mentioned above, makes it abundantly clear that for
‘public interest” the RBI 1S empowered to issue any
directive to any banking institution, and to prohibit
alienation of an NBFC’sS property. The term ‘Public
interest” has no rigid definition. It has to be
understood and interpreted in reference to the context
in which it is used. The concept derives its meaning
from the statute where it occurs, the transaction
involved, the state of society and its needs.° Justice

V. Ramasubramanian, speaking for a three judges Bench

5 Bihar Public Service Commission vs. Saiyed Hussain Abbas Rizwi and Anr.; (2012) 13 SCC
61.
Page 26 of 52
in Internet and Mobile Association of India®, (Supra),
gave a wide meaning to ‘public interest’, in context of

S. 35-A of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949:

“176. eeseee AS we have indicated
elsewhere, the power under Section 35-
A to issue directions is_ to. be
exercised under four contingencies,
namely, (1) public interest, (11)
interest of banking policy, (111)
interest of the depositors and (iv)
interest of the banking company. The
expression “banking policy” is defined
in Section 5(ca) to mean any policy
specified by RBI (i) in the interest
of the banking system, (11) in the
interest of monetary stability and
(111) sound economic growth. Public
interest permeates all these areas...”

8.8 On the omission to advert to the~- statutory
provisions on the basis of which the RBI acted, we can
seek guidance from the ratio in Peerless’ General
Finance and Investment Co. Ltd. Vs. RBI’ where this

court, speaking through Justice N. M. Kasliwal, held

that:

“71. It is settled law that so long as
the power is traceable to the statute,
mere omission to recite the provision
does not denude the power of _ the

6 Supra at 4.
7 (1992)2 SCC 343.
Page 27 of 52
legislature or rule making authority
to make the regulations, nor
considered without authority of Taw.
Section 114(e) of the Evidence Act
draws a statutory presumption’ that
official acts are regularly performed
and reached satisfactorily on
consideration of relevant facts. The
absence of reiteration of objective
satisfaction in the preamble as of one
under Section 45-L does not denude the
powers, the RBI admittedly has under
Section 45-L, to justify the actions.
Though Section 45-L was neither
expressly stated nor mentioned in the
preamble of the Directions of _ the
required recitation of satisfaction of
objective facts to issue the
directions from the facts and
Circumstances it is demonstrated that
the RBI had such satisfaction in its
consideration of its power’ under
Section 45-L, when the Directions were
issued. Even otherwise Section 45-K(3)
itself is sufficient to uphold _ the
directions.” (Emphasis added)

8.9 The above makes it clear that, it is not necessary
for RBI to mention a specific provision before issuing
directions, for it to have statutory consequences. All

that 1s required is the authority under the law, to

issue such direction.

8.10 The learned Senior Counsel for the defendant in
our estimation 1S correct in his’ submission that RBI

Page 28 of 52
directives carry statutory force, gathering authority
from the provisions of both the RBI Act, 1934 and the
Banking Regulation Act, 1949. In Peerless General
Finance (1I)°®, in the context of S. 45-kK and S. 45-L of
the RBI Act, 1934 this court, speaking through Justice
N M Kasliwal, relied on State of U.P. Vs. Babu Ram
Upadhya’, and D.K.V. Prasada Rao vs. Government of
A.P.7° to significantly pronounce that directions issued
by RBI, are incorporated and become a part of the act
and must therefore be governed by the same principles
as the statute itself. This view was further affirmed
by this court in case of Internet and Mobile
Association of India*™* (Supra). Hence, it 1s undisputed
that any direction by the RBI, 1s compelling and
enforceable similarly like the provisions of the RBI

Act by its very nature.

8.11 In Sudhir Shantilal Mehta” (Supra), Justice S. B.
Sinha interpreting the implications of actions under S.
35-A of the Banking Regulation, 1949 and the intention

of legislature,

under the said provision are binding upon

companies:

8.12 Justice S. C. Agarwal,

RBI vs.

“57. The distinction between exercise
Of jurisdiction under the enabling
provisions contained in Section 36(1)
and the ones under Sections 21 and 35-
A of the Banking Regulation Act and
the provisions contained in Section
45-L of the Reserve Bank of India,
1934 1s absolutely clear and
unambiguous. In terms of Section 36,
Reserve Bank of India may caution or
prohibit the banking companies but in
terms of Sections 21 and 35-A of the
1949 Act it can issue’ binding
directions ...

58. Whether a circular letter issued
by a statutory authority would _ be
binding or not or whether the same has
a statutory force, would depend upon
the nature of the _ statute. For the
said purpose, the intention of the
legislature must be considered. Having
regard to the fact the Reserve Bank of
India exercised control over’ the
banking companies, we are of the
opinion that the said circular letter
was binding on the banking companies.
The officials of UCO Bank were,
therefore, bound by the said circular
letter.” (Emphasis added)

rightly observed that the directions

banking

speaking for this Court in

Peerless General Finance and Investment Co.

Page 30 of 52
Ltd. (II)** held in the context of S. 45-K of the RBI
Act, 1934, that RBI has the authority to issue any
directions for ensuring effective implementation of its

orders, and to achieve the object of the Act:

“27. .In the matter of construction of
enabling statutes the principle
applicable is that if the Legislature
enables something to be done, it gives
power at the same time, by necessary
implication, to do everything which is
indispensable for the purpose’ of
carrying out the purpose in view.
(See Craies on Statutes, 7th Edn. p.
258.) It has been held that the power
to make a law with respect to any
subject carries with it all _ the
ancillary and incidental powers’ to
make the law effective and workable
and to prevent evasion.”

8.13 For ensuring effective implementation of relevant
directions, RBI as was declared is not only vested with
Curative powers but also preventive powers, as was held
in Ganesh Bank of Kurundwad Ltd. Vs. Union of India.
Hence, it is not necessary for the bank to wait for a

direction to be violated, and then launch penal actions

against the offenders. But the RBI can also issue

13 (1996) 1 SCC 642.
14 (2006) 10 SCC 645.
Page 31 of 52
directions to ensure that the relevant

orders/directions are effectively followed.

8.14 Based on the discussion above, the RBI under Ss.
45-MB of the RBI Act, 1934 and 35-A of the Banking
Regulation Act, 1949 in our understanding has_ the
requisite authority to issue the communication dated
09" June, 1997. The omission by the RBI to mention any
enabling provision, doesn’t change the nature and
status of the direction. The statutory arrangement and
interpretation as above persuade us to hold that
actions in furtherance of grounds of ‘public policy’ by
the RBI was justified, for issuing the Notification
dated 10.04.1997. The notification itself clearly
mentioned that it 1s issued for the benefit’ of
depositors and creditors of CRB Capital. The RBI’s
communication dated 09.06.1997 was in fact a direction,
with the appropriate statutory backing traceable to S.
45-MB of the RBI Act as well as S. 35-A of the Banking
Regulation Act. The Learned Senior Counsel for the
defendant is therefore correct in saying that’ the
09.06.1997 direction was issued, in furtherance of and

Page 32 of 52
to effectively implement the 10.04.1997 notification
issued earlier by the RBI. As such the RBI’s
09.06.1997 Notification was definitely binding on the
defendant which as noted earlier, 1S a_ banking

institution.

8.15 Situated thus, the actual status of the RBI
Notification would have a bearing on the claim against
the defendant in the suit and the later proceeding.
The plaintiff, as can be noted, always had the option
of challenging its legality but they have never
specifically challenged those in the Suit. Therefore,
when the legality of the RBI Notification is not under
Challenge, relief can’t be granted in the Suit without
determining its legality. This in our perception can

by itself, put a quietus on the issue at hand.

8.16 That apart, when the claim in the Suit 1s
relatable to the embargo by the RBI, it was necessary
to implead RBI in the litigation, for getting more
Clarity on the issue. The plaintiff omitted to do so
at their own peril despite the defense set out on this

basis. Here we need to observe that the plaintiff is

Page 33 of 52
dominus litus, and they cannot be compelled to _ seek

relief against anyone.

8.17 According to us, the plaintiff cannot be granted
parity with its predecessor-in-interest, Shankar Lal
Saraf, who was paid interest which accrued in July,
1997 despite the RBI directive of 09.06.1997. The
defendant has explained this aberration by clarifying
that the payment to Shankar Lal Saraf was made before
the defendant was in receipt of the RBI directive.
Hence, the plaintiff cannot claim any advantage for
themselves or parity with its predecessor-in-interest,

on this cause.

V. SHADOW OVER SHANKAR LAL SARAF’S TRANSACTION:

9. The S. 531 of the Companies Act, 1956 (Corresponding
Ss. 328 and 329 of the Companies Act, 2013) being

relevant for the question, is extracted:

“531. Fraudulent Preference:

(1) Any transfer of property, movable
or immovable, delivery of goods,
payment, execution or other’ act
relating to property made, taken or
done by or against a company within
six months before the commencement of
its winding up which, had it been
Page 34 of 52
made, taken or done by or against an
individual within three months before
the presentation of an _ insolvency
petition on which he is adjudged
insolvent, would be deemed in his
insolvency a_ fraudulent’ preference,
Shall in the event of the company
being wound up, be deemed a fraudulent
preference of its creditors and _ be
invalid accordingly... “(Emphasis added)

9.1 S. 441(2) of the Companies Act, 1956 reveals that
Winding-up proceedings other than voluntary winding-up,
are said to have commenced from the date of
presentation of petition. For quick reference, S. 441

of the Companies Act, 1956 1s extracted herein:

“441, Commencement of winding up by
tribunal:

(1) Where, before the presentation of
a petition for the winding up of a
company by the Tribunal, a resolution
has been passed by the company for
voluntary winding up, the winding up
of the company shall be deemed to have
commenced at the time of the passing
of the resolution, and unless’ the
Tribunal, on proof of fraud or
mistake, thinks fit to direct
otherwise, all proceedings taken in
the voluntary winding up shall be
deemed to have been validly taken.

(2) In any other case, the winding up
of a company by the Tribunal shall be
deemed to commence at the time of the

Page 35 of 52
presentation of the petition for the
winding up.”

9.2 A conjoint reading of Ss. 531 and 441(2) of the
Companies Act, 1956 prima facie reveals that’ any
transfer of property by or against a company in
involuntary winding up, the suspect spell for deemed
fraudulent transaction is S1X months before
presentation of the winding up petition. In the
present case, the petition for winding-up was submitted
by RBI on 22.05.1997 and admittedly, the transfer in
Shankar Lal Saraf’s favor was executed in February,
1997. Hence, the defendant’s prima facie suspicion
that the transfer during the suspect spell, may be
deemed fraudulent, 1s not misplaced. Relevant here
would be to note that in 2019, a Division bench of this
court speaking through Justice Mohan Shantanagoudar in
the case of IDBI vs. Official Liguidator*® clarified
that two conditions need to be satisfied for a
transaction to be qualified as fraudulent preference:

First, Company’s dominant motive to prefer a particular

15 (2020) 15 SCC 517.
Page 36 of 52
creditor; Second, transfer executed within six month,
preceding filing of winding-up petition. The issue of
fraudulent preference is therefore no longer’ res
integra, and it iS unnecessary to labour on the issue

any further.

9.3 The suspicion harboured by the defendant is during
the suspect spell as supported by the Calcutta High
Court in its order dated 09.01.2001, where the writ
Court refused to interfere on the grounds that the
issue was in the teeth of the litigation pending in the

Delhi Company Court.

9.4 Significantly it has been admitted by Shankar Lal
Saraf in his Application (CA 1380/1998) to the Delhi
Company Court that the defendant was acting under the
advice of RBI, which treated the transfer of Bonds as
fraudulent. Additionally, the Learned Single Judge of
the Calcutta High Court, in his’ judgment dated
13.03.2015 recorded a finding that initially both, RBI
and the Official Liquidator, treated the transfer in
Shankar Lal Saraf’s favor, as fraudulent in the

following words: -

Page 37 of 52
“ON a winding up petition having
moved on 22" May, 1997, the Company
Court appointed a Professional
Liquidator. The RBI issued a letter to
the bank not to deal with the subject
bonds as the liquidator has treated
the same as_ fraudulent’ preference
under S. 531 of the Act...

Though it was held that the
transactions are genuine and cannot be
declared as fraudulent preference at
the instance of the Official
Liquidator, but the fact remains that
there was some claim over the subject
bonds...”

9.5 While the Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court
has set-aside the order of the Learned Single Judge,
the finding mentioned above at the relevant time, is

not refuted by the contesting party.

9.6 The cloud over the issue was cleared by the Company
Court judgment (17.12.2004) wherein, the defendant’s
Claim that the transfer in Shankar Lal Saraf’s favor
was ‘fraudulent preference’, was rejected.
Significantly as soon as this decision was communicated
to the defendant, payment was promptly made by the

defendant to the plaintiff, without hesitation.

Page 38 of 52
9.7 At this juncture it iS apposite to mention, that
the validity of the Company Court judgment dated
17.12.2004 has not been challenged by either party.
Hence, the judgment has attained finality and the issue
whether the transfer in Shankar Lal Saraf’s favor was

fraudulent, is therefore put to rest.

9.8 Based on the above discussion, it is clear that the
defendant’s impression that the transfer in favour of
Shankar Lal Saraf was not legitimate, was a reasonable
Opinion, shared by many, including the RBI and the
Official Liquidator. The defendant was in receipt of
the RBI’s directions, not to part with payment as the
Official Liquidator had treated the transaction as
fraudulent. This had clearly placed a shadow over the
plaintiff’s title to the Bonds and consequences must

Flow therefrom.

VI. WHETHER WITHHOLDING PAYMENT BONA FIDE?

10. Assuming ad arguendo, that the RBI directions
could be disregarded yet the Bonds and the interest
accrued thereon, were in the teeth of the litigation,

pending in the Company Court. The defendant
Page 39 of 52
proactively applied to the Official Liquidator on
multiple occasions seeking clarification on interest
payment. But, the Official Liquidator did not respond.
Hence, it is clear that despite the defendant’s best
intentions and proactive efforts, it would be imprudent
for the defendant to release the payment accrued on the
Suspect Bonds. When the Bonds were released from
dispute pending before the Company Court, the defendant
promptly complied with the order of the Learned Company

Court.

10.1 The Learned Counsel for the plaintiff has failed
to show how the defendant derived any undue benefit by
withholding the payment accrued on the Bonds. The
amount due on the Bonds was immediately transferred to
the ‘Accrued Interest’ head and was not used by the
defendant for their business. Hence, the plaintiff’s
contention that the defendant’s actions of withholding

payment were mala fide, 1S not acceptable to us.

10.2 The plaintiff also argues that the Company Court
judgment (17.12.2004) has attained finality and the

defendant is barred by res judicata from raising the

Page 40 of 52
issue of fraudulent’ preference. The issue of
fraudulent preference is no longer res integra and none
sought to challenge the Company Court’s judgment and
re-agitate the issue. Hence, this contention will be

of no advantage for the plaintiff.

VII. BOND STATUS AND OBLIGATION: “HOLDER IN _ DUE

COURSE” :

11. S. 8 of the Negotiable Instruments Act defines a
‘Holder’ of promissory note as any person who in his
Own name is entitled to the possession of the note and
to recovery of due amount, pursuant to the said note.
For ready reference, the relevant S. 9 of _ the
Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 which defines a

‘holder in due course’ is extracted as under:

“9, “Holder in due course”—

“Holder in due course” means’ any
person who for consideration became
the possessor of a promissory note,
bill of exchange or cheque if payable
to bearer, or the payee or indorsee
thereof, if payable to order, before
the amount mentioned in it became
payable, and without having sufficient
cause to believe that any defect
existed in the title of the person
from whom he derived his title.”

Page 41 of 52
11.1 This court speaking through Justice K Jayachandra
Reddy in the context of a cheque in the case of U.
Ponnappa Moothan Sons, Palghat Vs. Catholic Syrian Bank
Ltd. and Ors.*® juxtaposed the Indian position on
‘holder in due course’ with the position in English Law

to declare the following: -

“17..Under the Indian law a holder, to
be a holder in due course, must not
only have acquired the bill, note of
Cheque for valid consideration but
Should have acquired the cheque
without having sufficient cause_ to
believe that any defect existed in the
title of the person from whom he
derived his title. This’ condition
required that he should act in good
faith and with reasonable _ caution.
However, mere failure to prove bona
fide or absence of negligence on his
part would not negative his claim.
But, in a given case it is left to the
Court to decide whether the negligence
on part of the holder is so gross and
extraordinary as to presume that he
had sufficient cause to believe that
such title was’ defective...”(Emphasis
added )

11.2 The principles stated above in the context of

cheques can be extrapolated for promissory notes as

16 (1991) 1 SCC 113.
Page 42 of 52
well. Resultantly an obligation has been imposed on
the transferee of the promissory notes, to be deemed to
be a ‘Holder in due course’, that the notes should have
been acquired in good _ faith; after exercising
reasonable care and caution about the holder’s title.
In the present case, while the Shankar Lal Saraf’s
(holder) title over the Bonds/Promissory Notes is not
in dispute but as discussed earlier, Shankar’ Lal
Saraf’s holding stood cleared by the Company Court only
on 17.12.2004 but before the said judgment, there was a
Cloud over his title. Consequently, the plaintiff’s
status as ‘holder in due course’ was suspect at the

relevant point of time.

11.3 The defendant bank was therefore justified in
withholding payment till conclusion of dispute in
Company Court, even though the relief claimed was in
respect of an ‘unconditional undertaking’, as_ there
were reasonable legal concerns for the _ transaction

during the suspect spell, for making such payments.

VIII. ENTITLEMENT FOR INTEREST ON DELAYED PAYMENT AND

PENDENTE LITE INTEREST:

Page 43 of 52
12. It flows from the above discussion, that’ the
defendant was justified in withholding the accrued
dues. The actions of SIDBI were bona fides, in
furtherance of RBI directives, which were issued in
public interest. In the case of Clariant International
Ltd. Vs. SEBI*’, this court speaking through Justice S B
Sinha held that two conditions need to be satisfied
before awarding interest. First, that money should be
wrongfully withheld from the rightful owners; Second,
that there should be equitable considerations’ for
awarding said interest. In the case at hand, neither

of these conditions are found to be satisfied.

12.1 As per S. 34 of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC),
award of interest is a discretionary exercise, steeped
in equitable considerations. Interest is payable for
different purposes such as compensatory, penal, etc.
but these are not the situations in the case before us.
Here firstly, the defendant was justified in
withholding payment, as they were under RBI’s direction
to do so; secondly, the defendant hasn’t derived any

17 (2004) 8 SCC 524,
Page 44 of 52
undue benefit by their act and; thirdly, due payment
was promptly made to the plaintiffs upon settlement of
rights by the court. Moreover, the concerned
transactions were during the “suspect spell”. This in
our view shows that the defendant acted bona fide and
there was no undue delay on their part, to remit the

dues.

12.2 The plaintiff did pray for pendente lite interest
in the Trial Court but neither did the trial court
frame any issue in this regard, nor were any arguments
recorded. This shows that such claim was not pressed
by the plaintiff. Further, no ground is urged in the
appeal memo, that such an issue ought to have been
framed. Hence, it is clear that the plaintiff is not
serious on its claim for pendente lite interest. The

issue is rested accordingly.

IX. WAS PLAINTIFF’S DEMAND BARRED BY WAIVER/

ACQUIESCENCE?: -

13. It 1s evident from the record, that when the
payment warrants were received by the plaintiff, it

effaced the warrants by handwritten remark ‘Received’.
Page 45 of 52
Pertinently, in the first instance, protest was only
raised in reference to excessive TDS deduction by the
defendant while remitting the dues. The demand for
interest on delayed payment, was raised after passage
of 7 months, when the books of SIBCO were allegedly
audited. This justification does not appear to be
reasonable. In fact, as has been stated previously in
this judgment, the plaintiff was entitled to demand
interest for delayed payment in its writ petition as
well. But SIBCO has consistently failed to raise this
demand at every stage including at the stage of
accepting the sum tendered by the defendant, without

any protest.

13.1 Hence, it is clear that the plaintiff accepted the
payment from the defendant as due settlement of its
Claims. SIBCO’s failure to raise protest and demand
for interest at the earliest possible stage, amounted
to sub-silencio acceptance. Accordingly, the plaintiff
is barred from raising this demand after several months

applying the principle of waiver/acquiescence.

Page 46 of 52
X. WHETHER PRESENT SUIT BARRED BY CONSTRUCTIVE RES

JUDICATA 7:

14. The defendant has argued that the principle of
constructive res judicata would also offset’ the
plaintiff’s claim. Pertinently, the previous’ Bond
holder Shankar Lal Saraf could not possibly have
Claimed interest on delayed payment before the Company
Court for it lacked the jurisdiction to adjudicate
Claims unrelated to the Jliquidation proceedings,
against CRB Capital. But, the successor Bond holder
i1.e. the plaintiff could have claimed interest’ on
delayed payment from the writ court. SIBCO’s
Submission is not acceptable that the cause of action
arose only on 23.11.2005, when the defendant refused to
heed to the demand of interest on delayed payment. The
cause of action for the plaintiff accrued the first
time, when the defendant allegedly failed to pay timely
interest. Since such a claim was not raised in the
writ court, the subsequent Suit of SIBCO in our view,
is barred by the principle of Constructive Res
Judicata.

Page 47 of 52
XI. CONCLUSION:

15. It is clear from the discussion above, that the
RBI has wide supervisory powers’ over’ financial
institutions like SIDBI, in furtherance of which, any
direction issued by the RBI, deriving power from the
RBI Act or the Banking Regulation Act is statutorily
binding on the defendant. Admittedly, the RBI issued
Notification dated 10.04.1997, deriving power from S.
45-MB(2) of the RBI Act. Thereby, the RBI froze the
assets of CRB Capital on the grounds of public policy,
for the purpose of protecting interests of creditors

and depositors of CRB Capital.

15.1 The RBI did not cite any provision in its
Direction dated 09.06.1997 to the defendant, as it was
not under any compulsion to do so. It was sufficient
that the RBI’s power to issue such a direction could be
traced to either S.45-MB(2) of the RBI Act, or S. 35-A
of the Banking Regulation Act. Hence, the _ said
direction was statutorily binding on the defendant.
Without the said direction, the Notification dated

10.04.1997, would have been rendered toothless, causing

Page 48 of 52
irreparable harm to the creditors and depositors of CRB
Capital. In reference to the Directive dated
09.06.1997, the defendant proactively sought advice
from the Official Liquidator in regards to the payment
of interest income to the defendant. But, in absence
of the Official Liquidator’s consent and guidance, the
defendant could not have made the payment without
inviting onerous consequences for itself. Hence, it
can be said that the defendant acted prudently, being
conscious of the legal obligation, to withhold such

payment to the plaintiff.

15.2 Further, in reference to S. 531 of Companies Act,
1956 read with S. 441(2) of the same act, it cannot be
denied that there was a suspicion over the title of the
plaintiff’s predecessor-in-interest. Ipso facto, the
plaintiff’s title with transaction during the “suspect
spell” was also under a cloud. It is clear from the
discussion above that such suspicion was not misplaced,
as it was shared by the RBI as well as the Official
Liquidator. Immediately after the Company Court vide
its decision (17.12.2004), clarified the position that

Page 49 of 52
the plaintiff was in the clear for the concerned
transactions, the defendant has duly ensured compliance
with the said order. Hence, it is clear that the

defendant acted bona fide in withholding the payment.

15.3 The elements that could have weighed on _ the
defendant for not making timely payments are: TI)
Contravention of the RBI Directives; II) Issue being
related to the ongoing litigation in the Delhi Company
Court; III) Concerns with the defendant’s title over
the Bonds/promissory notes transacted during’ the
“suspect spell” and these perturbing elements can’t be
brushed aside as not relevant. We are therefore of the
view that even though the payment was demanded in
furtherance of an unconditional undertaking in _ the
Bonds, the defendant was not entitled to it till the

Company Court’s order dated 17.12.2004.

15.4 The plaintiff’s transaction of Bonds with Shankar
Lal Saraf does not sound right in this court’s
estimation, with purchase being made during’ the
“suspect spell” and concurrent alarm bells rung by the

RBI, and the Court in that duration. When SIBCO

Page 50 of 52
approached the Writ Court to validate their
transaction, they failed to put forth any claim for
interest on delayed payment. Curiously, the plaintiff
chose not to approach the Company Court directly and
instead relied upon Shankar Lal Saraf to secure a
favourable verdict on the issue. They even chose to
forgo the very first opportunity that arose_ for
Claiming interest on delayed payment, when~ the
defendant was remitting the amount due to the plaintiff
while complying with the Company Court’ verdict.
Pertinently the payment was accepted without protest
and only after about 7 months, additional sums were
demanded on the Bonds. Despite all these disquieting
factors, the plaintiffs, like the Shakespearean
character of Shylock, have raised the demand “I’ll have
my bond. Speak not against my bond.”*® As we see the
Situation, the holder of the Bond has received their
‘pound of flesh’, but they seem to want” more.
Additional sum in our estimation is not merited as
SIBCO has already received their just entitlement and

burdening the defendant with any further amount towards

18 Act 3 Scene 3 - The Merchant of Venice
Page 51 of 52
interest would be akin to Shylockian extraction of
blood from the defendant. Therefore the question
formulated in paragraph 3 of this judgment is answered

accordingly against the plaintiff.

15.5 In view of the forgoing, the defendant’s appeal
against the impugned judgment is allowed by restoring
the judgment of the Trial Court. The plaintiff’s cross-

appeal is however rejected.

15.6 With all the legal consequences flowing from
the above order, the appeals stand disposed of without

any order on cost.

JUDGMENT

M. R. Shah, J.

1. Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned Judgment
and Orders passed by the High Court of Judicature at Hyderabad for
the State of Telangana and State of Andhra Pradesh dated
13.11.2017 in Writ Petition No.37515 of 2017; Writ Petition No.37516
of 2017; Writ Petition No.37504 of 2017 and Writ Petition No.37498 of
2017 by which the High Court has allowed the said writ petitions
preferred by the respondents herein — original assessees and has
quashed the respective assessment orders passed by the Assessing
Officer — Commercial Tax Officer, Brodipet Circle, Guntur, the State of

Andhra Pradesh and others have preferred the present appeals.
2. That the respective respondents are the registered dealers
holding VAT Registration. The Assessing Officer passed the
assessment orders for the respective assessment years and
assessed the tax by order dated 25.07.2012. The particulars ina
tabular form are as under:

Civil Appeal No. Date of Order

Civil Appeal 2010-2011 9, 10,608/- 25.07.2012

No. 7669-2021

3. Feeling aggrieved and _ dissatisfied with the respective

Assessment Orders, the dealers/assesses preferred the appeals
before the Appellate Deputy Commissioner (CT), Guntur. The First
Appellate Authority remanded the case to the Assessing Officer.
Thereafter the Commissioner of Commercial Taxes exercised suo
moto revisional powers vide its proceedings dated 27.07.2014

against the order by the First Appellate Authority remanding the
matter to the AO. The respective dealers submitted their objections.
Pending the revisional proceedings before the Commissioner of
Commercial Taxes, the Assessing Officer issued show cause notices
for making fresh assessment orders consequent to the remand of the
cases by the First Appellate Authority. The respective dealers
Submitted their objections, inter alia, to the effect that when the suo
moto revisions are pending before the Commissioner, the Assessing
officer has no jurisdiction to make a fresh assessment In pursuance
of the remand order. Thereafter the Assessing Officer passed fresh
assessment orders consequent upon the remand of the case by the
First Appellate Authority. Instead of preferring an appeal/appeals
before the First Appellate Authority against the fresh assessment
orders, the dealers straight way filed writ petitions before the High
Court and by impugned judgment and orders, the High Court has
allowed the said writ petitions and quashed the fresh assessment
orders, solely on the ground that pending suo moto revisional
proceedings, the Assessing Officer ought not to have proceeded

further with the fresh assessment.

4. Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment

and orders passed by the High Court quashing and setting aside the
fresh assessment orders, the State has preferred the present
appeals. As per the Office Report, though served, nobody appears
on behalf of the respondent(s). Therefore, the hearing is proceeded

ex-parte.

5. Having heard learned counsel appearing for the State and
considering the impugned judgment and orders passed by the High
Court, we are of the opinion that the impugned judgment and orders
passed by the High Court, quashing and setting aside the fresh

assessment orders are unsustainable.

5.1 Firstly, the High Court ought not to have directly entertained the
writ petitions challenging the fresh assessment orders. The
respective dealers — assessees ought to have availed the alternative
remedy of appeals before the First Appellate Authority which were

availed earlier when the earlier assessment orders were passed.

5.2 Secondly, because the fresh assessment orders were passed
consequent upon the remand of the case by the First Appellate
Authority pending the revisional proceedings against the order of
remand, merely on that ground alone the fresh assessment orders

could not have been set aside.
5.3. Nothing has been observed by the High Court on the merits of
the fresh assessment orders. If the fresh assessment orders would
have gone against the State, in that case the State would have been
the aggrieved party and the State could have raised the objection that
pending suo moto revisional proceedings against the order of
remand, the Assessing Officer ought not to have proceeded further
with the fresh assessments. However, in the present case the fresh
assessments have gone against the respective dealers. Therefore,
as such the respective dealers were required to prefer the appeals
before the First Appellate Authority against the fresh assessment

orders.

5.4 In view of the above, the judgment and orders passed by the
High Court quashing and setting aside the fresh assessment orders
In the writ petitions under Article 226 of the Constitution of India are

unsustainable.

6. In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, all these
appeals succeed. The judgment and orders passed by the High
Court in Writ Petition No.37515 of 2017; Writ Petition No.37516 of

2017: Writ Petition No.37504 of 2017 and Writ Petition No.37498 of
2017 are hereby quashed and set aside. However, there shall be no

order as to costs.

CIVIL APPEAL NOS. /702/-/028 OF 2009

UNION OF INDIA & ORS. APPELLANT (S)

VERSUS

MANJU ARORA & ANR. RESPONDENT (S)

WITH

CIVIL APPEAL NOS.7/7150-7151 OF 2009

JUDGMENT

Hrishikesh Roy, J.

1. Heard Ms. Meera Patel, learned counsel appearing
for the appellants in both the matters. The respondents
in Civil Appeal Nos. 7027-7028 of 2009 are represented
by Mr. Rajiv Manglik, learned counsel. In Civil Appeal

Nos. 7150-7151 of 2009, the respective respondents are

=i presented by learned counsel Mr. Piyush Sharma and

eason :

Mr. A.P. Dhamija.

Page 1 of 16
2. The respondents herein are claiming the benefit of
Assured Career Progression Scheme (for. short “ACP
Scheme”) for the Central Government civilian employees
under the O.M. dated 9.8.1999 issued by the Ministry of
Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, Government
of India. The ACP Scheme provided for financial
upgradation to the next higher grade of pay for those
employees who could not get promotion after 12 years of
service. Second upgradation is similarly admissible

after 24 years of service.

3. Suman Lata Bhatia and Manju Arora who were
appointed as Senior Translator (Hindi), were offered
promotion to the higher post of Translation Officer
(Hindi) on regular basis. But due to personal grounds,
they refused the offered promotions. However,’ the
benefits under the ACP Scheme were given to the
respondents on 15.11.1999 but when it was found that
those were wrongly granted, the same were withdrawn by
orders dated 4.9.2002 and 10.10.2002 for Suman Lata

Bhatia and Manju Arora respectively. The withdrawal

Page 2 of 16
order adverted to the clarificatory 0O.M. dated
18.7.2001 which disentitled financial upgradation under
the ACP Scheme to those who had refused vacancies based
promotion. It 1s specifically reflected in the said
order that the employee (respondent herein) having
refused promotion on multiple occasions, cannot be said
to be stagnating as she, of her own volition has opted
to remain in the grade of Senior Translator (Hind1).
Accordingly, taking note of the response to the show
cause notice and rejecting the same, the ACP benefit
was withdrawn and the respondent was reverted back to
her earlier pay scale. Similar steps were taken for

the other employee as well.

4. The withdrawal of ACP’ benefit for the- two
respondents and one other was challenged before the
Central Administrative Tribunal, Principal Bench (for
Short “the Tribunal”) in OA No. 2673/2002 (Suman Lata
Bhatia), OA No. 2674/2002 (Veena Arora) and OA No.

3021/2002 (Manju Arora) respectively.

Page 3 of 16
5. In the analogous order (28.8.2003), the Tribunal
adverted to both OMs (9.8.1999 and 18.7.2001) and noted
that the ACP Scheme is to provide relief to employees
who are suffering stagnation in the same post for long
period of time. However, having regard to- the
Clarificatory communication as also the purport of the
Scheme and the fact that the original applicants had
refused regular promotion, they were held disentitled
to the upgraded pay scale in terms of the ACP Scheme.
The Tribunal opined that on refusal to accept regular
promotion, the employee cannot be considered to be
Stagnating as she has opted to remain in the existing
grade of her own volition. Consequently, the decision
of the employer to withdraw the ACP benefits to the
three applicants were found to be in order by declaring
that they are not entitled to the benefits of upgraded
pay scale, in terms of the ACP Scheme. However, the
proposed recovery of the differential pay on account of

cancellation of the pay upgradation was interdicted

Page 4 of 16
with the observation that the upgraded pay scale was

allowed without any misrepresentation from their side.

6. The above decision of the Tribunal declaring
disentitlement of the Original Applicants to the ACP
benefits were challenged respectively in the WP (C) No.
7227/2003 (Manju Arora), W.P. (C) No.7283/2003 (Suman
Lata) and both cases were taken up for _ analogous

consideration.

7. The Division Bench adverted to the condition No.
5.1 as also Condition No.10 in the O.M. dated 9.8.1999
to conclude that in case a particular employee had
turned down the offered promotion, the non-acceptance
of promotion would impact their second upgradation
only. It was concluded that the employees were rightly
given the benefit of first upgradation, which could not
have been withdrawn. Accordingly, the judgment of the
Tribunal was interfered and consequently, direction was
issued for restoration of the upgradation under the ACP

Scheme, to the concerned employees.

Page 5 of 16
8. The basic facts in the Civil Appeal Nos.7150-
7151/2009 are similar where the concerned respondents
Kanta Suri and Veena Arora were also appointed as
Senior Translator (Hindi) in the Air Headquarters. The
key point of distinction for these two employees was
that instead of regular promotion, both Kanta Suri and
Veena Arora were offered promotion on officiating basis
to the post of Translation Officer (Hindi) with the
Stipulation that the promotes are liable to reversion
if their seniors who are on deputation to other
office/posts, return to their present cadre in the Air

Force or due to any administrative reasons.

9. Additionally, it may be mentioned that the decision
in favor of the employees to the effect that their
refusal for promotion would impact only their second
upgradation, was based upon the common judgment dated
21.11.2007 of the Division Bench of the Delhi High
Court in the case of Suman Lata Bhatia and Manju Arora,

adverted earlier.

Page 6 of 16
10. The OM dated 9.8.1999 offering Assured Career
Progression for the Central Government Civilian
Employees was intended as a “safety net” to deal with
the problem of genuine stagnation and hardship faced by
the employees due to lack of adequate promotional
avenues. The ACP Scheme was introduced by~ the
government with appropriate modification on the basis
of the recommendation made by the Fifth Central Pay
Commission. Under the Scheme, it was decided to grant
financial upgradation after 12 years of regular service
and the second one after 12 years of regular service
from the date of the first financial upgradation,
Subject to fulfillment of prescribed conditions.
Conditions 5.1 and 10 thereof being relevant, are

extracted hereinbelow: -

“5.1 Two financial up-gradation under
the ACP Scheme in the entire Government
Service career of an employee shall be
counted against regular promotions
(including in-situ promotion and “fast
track promotion availed through limited
departmental competitive examination)
availed from the grade in which = an
employee was appointed as a_— direct
recruit. This shall mean that two

Page 7 of 16
financial up-gradation under the ACP
Scheme shall be available only if no
regular promotion during the prescribed
periods (12 and 24 years) have been
availed by an employee. If a employee
has already got one regular promotion, he
Shall qualify for the second financial
up-gradation only on completion of 24
years of regular service under the ACP
Scheme. In case two prior promotions on
regular basis have already been received
by an employee, no benefit under the ACP
Scheme shall accrue to him.

KK*KX KK*KX K*K*K* KK*KX

10. Grant of higher pay scale under the
ACP Scheme shall be conditional to the
fact that an employee, while accepting
the said benefit, shall be deemed to have
given his unqualified acceptance for
regular promotion on - occurrence- of
vacancy subsequently. In case he refuses
to accept the higher post on regular
promotion subsequently, he shall be
Subject to normal debarment for regular
promotion as prescribed in the general
instructions in this regard. However, as
and when he accepts regular promotion
thereafter, he shall become eligible for
the secondup-gradation under the ACP
Scheme only after he completes’~ the
required eligibility  service/_ period
under the ACP Scheme in that higher grade
Subject to the condition that the period
for which he was debarred for regular
promotion shall not count’  for_~ the
purpose. For example, if a persons has
got one financial up-gradation after

Page 8 of 16
rendering 12 years of regular service and
after 2 years there from if he refuses
regular promotion and i1is_ consequently
debarred for one year and subsequently he
is promoted to the higher’ grade on
regular basis after completion of 15
years (12+12+1) of regular service, he
Shall be eligible for consideration for
the second up-gradation under the ACP
Scheme only after rendering ten more
years in addition to two years of service
already rendered by him after the first
financial up-gradation (2+10) in _ the
higher grade 1.e. after 25 years
(12+12+1) of regular service because the
debarment period of one year cannot be
taken into account towards the required
12 years of regular service in that
higher grade.”

11. AS can be seen, the benefit of the financial
upgradation under the ACP Scheme shall be available
only if regular promotion during the- prescribed
intervals, 12 years and 24 years, could not be availed
by an employee. While Condition no. 5.1 1s clear to
this effect, the Division Bench unnecessarily referred
to condition No. 10 to hold in favor of employees who
have refused promotion offered to them. The Court was
of the opinion that the employees concerned are

entitled to one financial upgradation, even if they

Page 9 of 16
turn down the offer of promotion, as non-acceptance of
such promotion would impact only their second
upgradation. With such finding, the respondents were
held entitled to the relief under the ACP Scheme,
although it was a case of refusal of promotion offered

to the employee.

12. The learned counsel for the appellant has taken us
through the relevant conditions in the ACP’ Scheme
notified on 9.8.1999 and more particularly clause 5.1
and Clause 10 thereof. She has also brought to the
notice of the Court, the promotions offered to the
employees and their refusal to accept the promotion for
their own personal reasons, such as family needs or

movement to another station etc.

13. Reading of the ACP Scheme shows that financial
upgradation would accrue to an employee only if no
regular promotions have been received by her/him at the
prescribed intervals of 12 and 24 years respectively.

In the entire service career, an employee is entitled

Page 10 of 16
to financial upgradation if the concerned employee had
to suffer stagnation in the same post without benefit
of any regular promotion and, as earlier stated, the
O.M. dated 9.8.1999 was introduced as a “safety net” to
deal with the problems of genuine’ stagnation = and
hardship faced by the employees due to lack of adequate
promotional avenues. But can the benefit of the Scheme
be claimed by an employee when she, despite offer of
regular promotion, refuses to accept the same and
chooses to remain in the existing grade of her’ own

volition?

14. As can be seen from the records, Manju Arora and
Suman Lata Bhatia were offered promotion to _ higher
grade on multiple occasions, but they refused the same
and chose to continue in the existing pay scale. The
purport of the O.M. dated 9.8.1999 was subsequently
Clarified by the O.M. dated 18.7.2001 where it was
specifically provided that an employee who had _ been
offered regular vacancy based promotion before grant of

ACP benefit and the regular promotion was refused,

Page 11 of 16
She/he become ineligible to the grant of the ACP
benefits. Even without the clarificatory notification
dated 18.7.2001, a plain reading of clause 5.1 of the
O.M. dated 9.8.1999 makes it abundantly clear that an
employee who has opted to remain in the existing grade,
by refusing offer of promotion, forfeits the rights to
ACP benefits and such employee, on account of refusal,
can be considered for regular promotion only after

necessary debarment period is over.

15. However, despite the clear wordings in condition
5.1, the purport of the OM dated 9.8.1999 was missed
out in the impugned judgment and the learned Court
unnecessarily adverted to the words in condition 10 of
the O.M. to hold in favor of the employees who have

refused promotion for their own personal reasons.

16. We are quite certain that if a regular promotion is
offered but is refused by the employee before becoming
entitled to a financial upgradation, she/he shall not

be entitled to financial upgradation only because she

Page 12 of 16
has suffered stagnation. This is because, it 1s not a
case of lack of promotional opportunities but = an
employee opting to forfeit offered promotion, for her
Own personal reasons. However, this vital aspect was
not appropriately appreciated by the High Court while

granting relief to the employees.

17. It may also be observed that when an employee
refuses the offered promotion, difficulties in manning
the higher position might arise which give rise to
administrative difficulties as the concerned employee
very often refuse promotion in order to continue in

his/her own place of posting.

18. In the above circumstances, we find merit in the
Submissions made on behalf of the appellants.
Consequently, it is declared that the employees who
have refused the offer of regular promotion are
disentitled to the financial upgradation benefits
envisaged under the O.M. dated 9.8.1999. In this

Situation, the Scottish doctrine of “Approbate and

Page 13 of 16
Reprobate” springs to mind. The English equivalent of
the doctrine was explained in Lissenden v. CAV Bosch

Ltd.* wherein Lord Atkin observed at page 429,

U saeseseees In cases where the doctrine does
apply the person concerned has the choice
of two rights, either of which he is at
liberty to adopt, but not both. Where the
doctrine does apply, if the person to
whom the choice belongs irrevocably and
with knowledge adopts the one he cannot
afterwards assert the other............ "

The above doctrine is attracted to the
Circumstances in this case. The concerned employees
cannot therefore be allowed to simultaneously approbate
and reprobate, or to put it colloquially, “eat their

cake and have it too”. It is declared accordingly for

the respondents in the C.A. Nos.7027-28/2009.

19. However, the above would not apply to the two
respondent employees Kanta Suri and Veena Arora in C.A
Nos.7150-7151/2009 as they were not offered regular

promotion but conditional promotion on officiating

1 [1940] A.C 412
Page 14 of 16
basis subject to reversion, by the order’ dated
29.12.1988. These two employees cannot be said to have
exercised a choice between alternatives and as such the
above Principle would not apply and their refusal to
accept the officiating promotion cannot be held against
them. The refusal of the promotion offered by the
communication dated 29.12.1988 will not disentitle the
two employees, Kanta Suri and Veena Arora to_ the
benefits under the ACP Scheme. It 1is_ declared

accordingly.

20. Since the respondents have reached the age of
Superannuation in the meantime, the consequential
relief under this order should be made available to the
two eligible employees (if not granted), within three

months from today.

21. For the foregoing, the first set of Appeals l.e.
Civil Appeal Nos.7027-7028 of 2009 are allowed.

However, the second set of Appeals i.e. Civil Appeal

Page 15 of 16
Nos.7150-7151 of 2009 stand dismissed. There shall be

no order as to costs.

CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION

CIVIL APPEAL NO. 7697 OF 2021

Ellora Paper Mills Limited ... Appellant

Versus

The State of Madhya Pradesh ...Respondent

JUDGMENT

M.R. SHAH, J.

1. Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment
and order dated 27.08.2021 passed by the High Court of Madhya
Pradesh in A.C. No. 100/2019, by which the application preferred by the

appellant under Section 14 read with Sections 11 and 15 of the

eA ation and Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as the

eason :

‘Arbitration Act, 1996’) seeking termination of the mandate of originally
constituted Arbitral Tribunal and to appoint a new arbitrator has been
dismissed, the original applicant before the High Court has preferred the

present appeal.

2. That the respondent herein issued a tender for supply of the cream
wove paper and duplicating paper for the year 1993-94. The appellant
herein participated in the said tender process and was awarded the
contract vide supply order dated 22.09.1993. A dispute arose between
the appellant and the respondent. According to the appellant herein,
though it supplied 420 MT of cream wove paper and 238 MT of
duplicating paper to the respondent, the latter not only did not make the
payment of 90% of the amount as per the terms of the contract, but also
rejected some consignments without any justification, causing loss to It.
The respondent herein vide letter dated 15.11.1993 informed the
appellant that the paper supplied by it did not conform to the

specification and therefore could not be utilized.

2.1 Thereafter, the appellant herein filed a civil suit in the year 1994
seeking the relief of permanent injunction against the respondent in the
Civil Court at Bhopal seeking to restrain it from awarding the supply
order to a third party. The respondent, in the meantime, awarded the
contract to the third party for the remaining supply. Therefore, the

aforesaid civil suit became infructuous.
2.2 The appellant thereafter filed another suit seeking recovery of an
amount of Rs.95,32,103/- bearing Civil Suit No. 2-B/1998 before the Civil
Court at Bhopal. In the said suit, the respondent preferred an
application under Section 8 of the Arbitration Act, 1996 seeking stay of
the proceedings on the ground that there exists an arbitration clause in
the agreement between the parties. The Civil Court rejected the said
application vide order dated 27.02.1999. The respondent filed revision
petition No. 1117/1999 before the High Court which came to be allowed
by the High Court vide order dated 03.05.2000. The High Court referred
the parties to arbitration by the Stationery Purchase Committee

comprising of the officers of the respondent.

2.3 Against the order passed by the High Court allowing the revision
petition and referring the parties to the arbitration, the appellant herein
filed a special leave petition bearing S.L.P.(Civil) No. 13914/2000 before
this Court. The same came to be dismissed as withdrawn vide order

dated 28.09.2000.

2.4 The Arbitral Tribunal was constituted called as “Stationery
Purchase Committee” comprising the officers of the respondent. The
appellant filed its objections to the constitution of the Arbitral
Tribunal/Stationery Purchase Committee on 12.09.2000. The appellant

herein also challenged its jurisdiction by filing an application under
Section 13 of the Arbitration Act, 1996. The Arbitral Tribunal vide order
dated 2.2.2001 rejected the said application. Aggrieved thereby, the
appellant herein filed a writ petition before the High Court being Writ
Petition No. 1824/2001 which came to be dismissed vide order dated
24.01.2017 with liberty to the appellant to raise objections before the

appropriate forum.

2.5 Subsequently, the appellant filed the present application before the
High Court being AC No. 100/2019 under Section 14 read with Sections
11 & 15 of the Arbitration Act, 1996 seeking termination of the mandate
of originally constituted Arbitral Tribunal -— Stationery Purchase
Committee comprising of officers of the respondent and for appointment
of a new arbitrator. Before the High Court, the appellant herein heavily
relied upon Section 12(5) of the Arbitration Act, 1996. Relying upon the
decision of this Court in the case of TRF Limited v. Energo Engineering
Projects Limited, reported in (2017) 8 SCC 377, it was submitted on
behalf of the appellant that all the five officers constituting the Stationery
Purchase Committee, being the employees of the respondent had
rendered themselves ineligible to continue as arbitrators. It was
submitted that since they had become ineligible to continue as
arbitrators, they also could not appoint another person as arbitrator. It

was also contended that the original members of the Arbitral Tribunal,
who initiated the proceedings had since ceased to hold their respective
offices, in any case, a new Arbitral Tribunal had to be constituted and
therefore an impartial and independent arbitrator was required to be

appointed in terms of Section 11 of the Arbitration Act, 1996.

2.6 However, after referring to and considering the decisions of this
Court in the cases of Aravali Power Co. Power Ltd. v. Era Infra
Engineering, reported in (2017) 15 SCC 32; Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.
v. Raja Transport Pvt. Ltd., reported in (2009) 8 SCC 520; ACE Pipeline

Referring to the aforesaid decisions of this Court, it is observed and held
by the High Court that the Amendment Act, 2015 shall be made effective
w.e.f. 23.10.2015 and cannot have retrospective operation in the
arbitration proceedings already commenced unless the parties otherwise
agree and therefore when in the present case the Arbitral Tribunal was

constituted much prior to the Amendment Act, 2015 and the Arbitral
Tribunal commenced its proceedings, the Amendment Act, 2015 —
Section 12(5) of the Arbitration Act, 2016 shall not be applicable.
Observing so, the High Court by the impugned judgment and order has
dismissed the application filed by the appellant herein under Section 14
read with Sections 11 & 15 of the Arbitration Act, 1996 and has observed
that it would be open for the appellant to participate in proceedings
before the Arbitral Tribunal constituted by the respondent as Stationery

Purchase Committee.

2./ Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment
and order passed by the High Court, the original applicant before the

High Court has preferred the present appeal.

3. Shri Sandeep Bajaj, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the
appellant has vehemently submitted that the impugned judgment and
order passed by the High Court rejecting the application submitted by
the appellant under Section 14 read with Sections 11 & 15 of the
Arbitration Act, 1996 is just contrary to the recent decision of this Court in
the case of Jaipur Zila Dugdh Utpadak Sahkari Sangh Limited v. Ajay
Sales & Suppliers, 2021 SCC OnLine SC 730. It is submitted that as
held by this Court in the aforesaid decision, in view of the mandate under
sub-section (5) of Section 12 read with Seventh Schedule, the Arbitral

Tribunal constituted in the present case — Stationery Purchase
Committee consisting of the officers of the respondent has lost its
mandate. It is submitted that continuation of such Arbitral Tribunal would
be frustrating the object and purpose of the Amendment Act, 2015, by
which sub-section (5) to Section 12 read with Seventh Schedule was
inserted. It is submitted that as held by this Court, Section 12 has been
amended by Amendment Act, 2015 to provide for ‘neutrality of
arbitrators’ and in order to achieve this, sub-section (5) to Section 12
provides that notwithstanding any prior agreement to the contrary, any
person whose relationship with the parties or counsel or the subject
matter of the dispute falls under any of the categories specified in the

Seventh Schedule, he shall be ineligible to be appointed as an arbitrator.

3.1 It is submitted that in the aforesaid decision, this Court negatived
the submission that once the contractor participated in the arbitration
proceedings before the Arbitral Tribunal by filing a statement of claim,
thereafter it would not be open for him to approach the Court invoking
sub-section (5) to Section 12 and pray for appointment of a fresh Arbitral
Tribunal. It is submitted that unless and until there is an express
agreement in writing to continue with the arbitration proceedings by the
earlier Arbitral Tribunal, such an application to terminate the mandate of
the earlier Arbitral Tribunal and to appoint a fresh arbitrator would be

maintainable.
3.2 It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing on behalf
of the appellant that in the present case, as such, the High Court has
committed a grave error in observing and holding that the arbitration
proceedings before the Stationery Purchase Committee — Arbitral
Tribunal had commenced and that the appellant had participated. It is
urged that in the present case, the Stationery Purchase Committee —
arbitral Tribunal did not commence the arbitration proceedings in view of
the stay granted by the High Court in Writ Petition No. 1824/2001, which
was operative from 4.5.2001 to 24.01.2017. It is submitted that in fact
the earlier incumbents of the Stationery Purchase Committee — Arbitral
Tribunal retired and no steps were taken to constitute a fresh Arbitral
Tribunal. It is therefore contended, it cannot be said that any further
steps were taken by the earlier Arbitral Tribunal in the arbitration
proceedings. It is submitted that in any case in view of the mandate
under Section 12(5) read with Seventh Schedule, the members of the
earlier Arbitral Tribunal have lost their mandate and are ineligible to
continue as members of the Arbitral Tribunal and therefore a fresh

Arbitral Tribunal is to be constituted.

4. While opposing the present appeal, Shri Nachiketa Joshi, learned
Advocate appearing on behalf of the respondent-State has vehemently

Submitted that in the facts and circumstances of the case and more
particularly when the Arbitral Tribunal as per the agreement entered into
between the parties was constituted in the year 2000, the High Court
has rightly refused to appoint a fresh Arbitral Tribunal by holding that
Section 12(5) read with Seventh Schedule which has been inserted in
the statute by Amendment Act, 2015 w.e.f. 23.10.2015 shall not be

applicable retrospectively.

4.1 It is submitted that in the present case, on one ground or the other,
and by initiating the proceedings one after another, the appellant did not
permit the earlier Arbitral Tribunal to proceed further with the arbitration

proceedings.

4.2  I\t is urged that the impugned judgment and order passed by the
High Court is a well-reasoned order after considering catena of decisions
of this Court referred to in the impugned order and therefore the same

may not be interfered with by this Court.

4.3. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent has also
submitted that in the facts and circumstances of the case, the decision of
this Court in the case of Jaipur Zila Dugdh Utpadak Sahkari Sangh
Limited (Supra) is not applicable. It is submitted that in the said case, the
arbitrator was appointed after amendment of the Arbitration Act, 2015.
However, in the present case, the arbitrator was appointed

approximately 20 years prior thereto and thereafter the arbitration
proceedings commenced and even the appellant also participated. It is
therefore contended that the amended Section 12(5) of the Arbitration
Act which is brought in the statute by way of amendment in 2015 shall
not be applicable retrospectively. It is submitted that Section 12(5) of the

Arbitration Act shall have to be made applicable prospectively.

5. We have heard the learned counsel for the respective parties at
length. Having heard learned counsel for the respective parties and on
considering the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court,
the short question which is posed for consideration of this Court is,
whether, the Stationery Purchase Committee — Arbitral Tribunal
consisting of the officers of the respondent has lost the mandate,
considering Section 12(5) read with Seventh Schedule of the Arbitration
Act, 1996. If the answer is in the affirmative, in that case, whether a

fresh arbitrator has to be appointed as per the Arbitration Act, 1996?

6. It is not in dispute that the High Court earlier constituted the
Arbitral Tribunal of Stationery Purchase Committee comprising of
officers of the respondent, viz, Additional Secretary, Department of
Revenue as President and (i) Deputy Secretary, Department of
Revenue, (il) Deputy Secretary, General Administration Department, (ili)
Deputy Secretary, Department of Finance, (iv) Deputy Secretary/Under

Secretary, General Administration Department and (v) Senior Deputy

10
Controller of Head Office, Printing as Members. It may be true that the
earlier Arbitral Tribunal -— Stationery Purchase Committee was
constituted as per the agreement entered into between the parties. It is
also true that initially the said Arbitral Tribunal was constituted by the
High Court in the year 2001, however, thereafter Stationery Purchase
Committee — Arbitral Tribunal could not commence the arbitration
proceedings in view of number of proceedings initiated by the appellant.
There was a stay granted by the High Court from 4.5.2001 to 24.01.2017
and thereafter in the year 2019, the present application was preferred
before the High Court invoking Section 14 read with Sections 11 & 15 of
the Arbitration Act, 1996 seeking termination of the mandate of the
originally constituted Arbitral Tribunal and to appoint a new arbitrator. It
has also come on record that in between, the officers who were
members of the Stationery Purchase Committee — Arbitral Tribunal had
retired. At this stage, we are not considering whether those persons
could have been continued as members of the Stationery Purchase
Committee — Arbitral or not. However, the fact remains that after the
constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal in the year 2001, no further steps
whatsoever have been taken in the arbitration proceedings and therefore
technically it cannot be said that the arbitration proceedings by the

Arbitral Tribunal — Stationery Purchase Committee has commenced.

11
7. AS observed hereinabove, the Arbitral Tribunal — Stationery
Purchase Committee consisted of officers of the respondent-State.
Therefore, as per Amendment Act, 2015 — Sub-section (5) of Section 12
read with Seventh Schedule, all of them have become ineligible to
become arbitrators and to continue as arbitrators. Section 12 has been
amended by Amendment Act, 2015 based on the recommendations of
the Law Commission, which specifically dealt with the issue of “neutrality
of arbitrators”. To achieve the main purpose for amending the provision,
namely, to provide for “neutrality of arbitrators”, sub-section (5) of
Section 12 lays down that notwithstanding any prior agreement to the
contrary, any person whose relationship with the parties or counsel or
the subject matter of the dispute falls under any of the categories
specified in the Seventh Schedule, he shall be ineligible to be appointed
as an arbitrator. In such an eventuality, |.e., when the arbitration clause
is found to be foul with the amended provision, the appointment of the
arbitrator would be beyond the pale of the arbitration agreement,
empowering the Court to appoint such an arbitrator as may be
permissible. That would be the effect of the non obstante clause
contained in sub-section (5) of Section 12 and the other party cannot
insist upon the appointment of the arbitrator in terms of the arbitration
agreement. It cannot be disputed that in the present case, the

Stationery Purchase Committee -Arbitral Tribunal comprising of officers

12
of the respondent-State are all ineligible to become and/or to continue as
arbitrators in view of the mandate of sub-section (5) of Section 12 read
with Seventh Schedule. Therefore, by operation of law and by amending
Section 12 and bringing on statute sub-section (5) of Section 12 read
with Seventh Schedule, the earlier Arbitral Tribunal — Stationery
Purchase Committee comprising of Additional Secretary, Department of
Revenue as President and (i) Deputy Secretary, Department of
Revenue, (il) Deputy Secretary, General Administration Department, (ili)
Deputy Secretary, Department of Finance, (iv) Deputy Secretary/Under
Secretary, General Administration Department and (v) Senior Deputy
Controller of Head Office, Printing as Members, has lost its mandate and
such an Arbitral Tribunal cannot be permitted to continue and therefore

a fresh arbitrator has to be appointed as per Arbitration Act, 1996.

8. An identical question came to be considered by this Court in the
case of Jaipur Zila Dugdh Utpadak Sahkari Sangh Limited (Supra), and
after considering the decisions of this Court in the case of TRF (supra)
and other decisions on the point, in paragraphs 13, 14 and 15, it is

observed and held as under:

“13. So far as the submission on behalf of the petitioners that the
agreement was prior to the insertion of Sub-section (5) of Section 12 read
with Seventh Schedule to the Act and therefore the disqualification under
Sub-section (5) of Section 12 read with Seventh Schedule to the Act shall
not be applicable and that once an arbitrator - Chairman started the

13
arbitration proceedings thereafter the High Court is not justified in
appointing an arbitrator are concerned the aforesaid has no substance
and can to be accepted in view of the decision of this Court in 7rf
Ltd. v.Energo Engineering Projects Ltd., (2017) 8 SCC _ 3/77; Bharat
Broadband Network Limited v. United Telecoms Limited, (2019) 5 SCC
755; Voestalpine Schienen GMBH v. Delhi Metro’ Rail Corporation
Limited, (2017) 4 SCC 665. In the aforesaid decisions this Court had an
occasion to consider in detail the object and purpose of insertion of
Subsection (5) of Section 12 read with Seventh Schedule to the Act. In the
case of Voestalpine Schienen GMBH (Supra) it is observed and held by
this Court that the main purpose for amending the provision was to provide
for ‘neutrality of arbitrators’. It is further observed that in order to achieve
this, Sub-section (5) of Section 12 lays down that notwithstanding any
prior agreement to the contrary, any person whose relationship with the
parties or counsel or the subject-matter of the dispute falls under any of
the categories specified in the Seventh Schedule, he shall be ineligible to
be appointed as an arbitrator. It is further observed that in such an
eventuality i.e. when the arbitration clause finds foul with the amended
provisions (Sub-section (5) of Section 12 read with Seventh Schedule) the
appointment of an arbitrator would be beyond pale of the arbitration
agreement, empowering the court to appoint such arbitrator as may be
permissible. It is further observed that, that would be the effect of non
obstante clause contained in sub-section (5) of Section 12 and the other
party cannot insist on appointment of the arbitrator in terms of the
arbitration agreement.

14. It is further observed and held by this Court in the aforesaid decision
that independence and impartiality of the arbitrator are the hallmarks of
any arbitration proceedings. Rule against bias is one of the fundamental
principles of natural justice which apply to all judicial and quasi-judicial
proceedings. It is further observed that it is for this reason that
notwithstanding the fact that relationship between the parties, to the
arbitration and the arbitrators themselves are contractual in nature and the
source of an arbitrator's appointment is deduced from the agreement
entered into between the parties, notwithstanding the same_non-
independence and non-impartiality of such arbitrator would render him
ineligible to conduct the arbitration. It is further observed that the genesis
behind this rational is that even when an arbitrator is appointed in terms of
contract and by the parties to the contract, he is independent of the
parties. In paragraphs 16 to 18 it is observed and held as under:

14
“16. Apart from other amendments, Section 12 was also amended
and the amended provision has already been reproduced above.
This amendment is also based on the recommendation of the Law
Commission which specifically dealt with the issue of ‘neutrality of
arbitrators’ and a discussion in this behalf is contained in paras 53
to 60 and we would like to reproduce the entire discussion
hereinbelow:

“NEUTRALITY OF ARBITRATORS

53. It is universally accepted that any quasi-judicial process,
including the arbitration process, must be in accordance with
principles of natural justice. In the context of arbitration, neutrality
of arbitrators, viz. their independence and impartiality, is critical to
the entire process.

54. In the Act, the test for neutrality is set out in Section 12(3)
which provides -

‘12.(3) “An arbitrator may be challenged only if -

(a) circumstances exist that give rise to justifiable doubts as
to his independence or impartiality...”

55. The Act does not lay down any other conditions to identify the
“circumstances” which give rise to “justifiable doubts”, and it is
clear that there can be many such circumstances and situations.
The test is not whether, given the circumstances, there is any
actual bias for that is setting the bar too high; but, whether the
circumstances in question give rise to any _ justifiable
apprehensions of bias.

56. The limits of this provision has been tested in the Indian
Supreme Court in the context of contracts with State entities
naming particular persons/designations (associated with that
entity) as a potential arbitrator. It appears to be settled by a
series of decisions of the Supreme Court (See Executive
Engineer, Irrigation Division, Puri v. Gangaram Chhapolia, (1984)
3 SCC 627; Secretary to Government Transport Department,
Madras v. Munusamy Mudaliar, 1988 Supp SCC
651; International Authority of India v. K.D. Bali, (1988) 2 SCC
360; S. Rajan v. State of Kerala, (1992) 3 SCC 608; Indian Drugs
& Pharmaceuticals v. Indo-Swiss Synthetics Germ Manufacturing

15
Co. Ltd., (1996) 1 SCC 54; Union of India v. M.P. Gupta, (2004)
10 SCC 504; Ace Pipeline Contract Pvt. Ltd. v. Bharat Petroleum
Corporation Ltd., (2007) 5 SCC 304) that arbitration agreements
in government contracts which provide for arbitration by a serving
employee of the department, are valid and enforceable. While
the Supreme Court, in Indian Oil Corp. Ltd. v. Raja Transport (P)
Ltd., (2009) 8 SCC 520 carved out a minor exception in
situations when the arbitrator

“was the controlling or dealing authority in regard to the
subject contract or if he is a direct subordinate (as
contrasted from an officer of an inferior rank in some other
department) to the officer whose decision is the subject
matter of the dispute” (SCC p. 533, para 34) and this
exception was used by the Supreme Court in Denel
(Proprietary) Ltd. v.Govt. of India,  Méinistry — of
Defence, (2012) 2 SCC £759:AIR 2012 #SC
817 and Bipromasz Bipron Trading SA v. Bharat
Electronics Ltd., (2012) 6 SCC 384, to appoint an
independent arbitrator under section 11, this is _ not
enough.

57. The balance between procedural fairness and binding nature
of these contracts, appears to have been tilted in favour of the
latter by the Supreme Court, and the Commission believes the
present position of law is far from 18 satisfactory. Since the
principles of impartiality and independence cannot be discarded
at any stage of the proceedings, specifically at the stage of
constitution of the arbitral tribunal, it would be incongruous to say
that party autonomy can be exercised in complete disregard of
these principles - even if the same has been agreed prior to the
disputes having arisen between the parties. There are certain
minimum levels of independence and impartiality that should be
required of the arbitral process regardless of the parties’
apparent agreement. A sensible law cannot, for instance, permit
appointment of an arbitrator who is himself a party to the dispute,
or who is employed by (or similarly dependent on) one party,
even if this is what the parties agreed. The Commission hastens
to add that Mr. PK Malhotra, the ex officio member of the Law
Commission suggested having an exception for the State, and

16
allow State parties to appoint employee arbitrators. The
Commission is of the opinion that, on this issue, there cannot be
any distinction between State and non-State parties. The concept
of party autonomy cannot be stretched to a point where it
negates the very basis of having impartial and independent
adjudicators for resolution of disputes. In fact, when the party
appointing an adjudicator is the State, the duty to appoint an
impartial and independent adjudicator is that much more onerous
- and the right to natural justice cannot be said to have been
waived only on the basis of a “prior” agreement between the
parties at the time of the contract and before arising of the
disputes.

58. Large-scale amendments have been suggested to address
this fundamental issue of neutrality of arbitrators, which the
Commission believes is critical to the functioning of the
arbitration process in India. In particular, amendments have been
proposed to sections 11, 12 and 14 of the Act.

59. The Commission has proposed the requirement of having
specific disclosures by the arbitrator, at the stage of his
*opossible* appointment, regarding existence of any relationship
or interest of any kind which is likely to give rise to justifiable
doubts. The Commission has proposed the incorporation of the
Fourth Schedule, which has drawn from the red and orange lists
of the IBA Guidelines on Conflicts of Interest in International
Arbitration, and which would be treated as a “guide” to determine
whether circumstances exist which give rise to such justifiable
doubts. On the other hand, in terms of the proposed section
12(5) of the Act and the Fifth Schedule which incorporates the
categories from the red list of the IBA Guidelines (as above), the
person proposed to be appointed as an arbitrator shall be
*ineligible* to be so appointed, notwithstanding any prior
agreement to the contrary. In the event such an ineligible person
iS purported to be appointed as an arbitrator, he shall be de jure
deemed to be unable to perform his functions, in terms of the
proposed explanation to section 14. Therefore, while the
*disclosure* is required with respect to a broader list of
categories (as set out in the Fourth Schedule, and as based on
the Red and Orange lists of the IBA Guidelines), the *ineligibility*

17
to be appointed as an arbitrator (and the consequent de jure
inability to so act) follows from a smaller and more serious sub-
set of situations (as set out in the Fifth Schedule, and as based
on the Red list of the IBA Guidelines).

60. The Commission, however, feels that *real* and *genuine*
party autonomy must be respected, and, in certain situations,
parties should be allowed to waive even the categories of
ineligibility as set in the proposed Fifth Schedule. This could be in
situations of family arbitrations or other arbitrations where a
person commands the blind faith and trust of the parties to the
dispute, despite the existence of objective “justifiable doubts”
regarding his independence and impartiality. To deal with such
situations, the Commission has proposed the proviso to section
12(5), where parties may, subsequent to disputes having arisen
between them, waive the applicability of the proposed section
12(5) by an express agreement in writing. In all other cases, the
general rule in the proposed section 12(5) must be followed. In
the event the High Court is approached in connection with
appointment of an arbitrator, the Commission has proposed
seeking the disclosure in terms of section 12(1) and in which
context the High Court or the designate is to have “due regard” to
the contents of such disclosure in appointing the arbitrator.”

(emphasis supplied)

17. We may put a note of clarification here. Though, the Law
Commission discussed the aforesaid aspect under the heading
“Neutrality of Arbitrators’, the focus of discussion was on
impartiality and independence of the arbitrators which has relation
to or bias towards one of the parties. In the field of international
arbitration, neutrality is generally related to the nationality of the
arbitrator. In international sphere, the “appearance of neutrality” is
considered equally important, which means that an arbitrator is
neutral if his nationality is different from that of the parties.
However, that is not the aspect which is being considered and the
term “neutrality” used is relatable to impartiality and independence
of the arbitrators, without any bias towards any of the parties. In
fact, the term “neutrality of arbitrators” is commonly used in this
context as well.

18
18. Keeping in mind the aforequoted recommendation of the Law
Commission, with which spirit, Section 12 has been amended by
the Amendment Act, 2015, it is manifest that the main purpose for
amending the provision was to provide for neutrality of arbitrators.
In order to achieve this, sub-section (5) of Section 12 lays down
that notwithstanding any prior agreement to the contrary, any
person whose relationship with the parties or counsel or the
subject matter of the dispute falls under any of the categories
specified in the Seventh Schedule, he shall be ineligible to be
appointed as an arbitrator. In such an eventuality i.e. when the
arbitration clause finds foul with the amended provisions extracted
above, the appointment of an arbitrator would be beyond pale of
the arbitration agreement, empowering the court to appoint such
arbitrator(s) as may be permissible. That would be the effect of
non obstante clause contained in sub-section (5) of Section 12
and the other party cannot insist on appointment of the arbitrator in
terms of arbitration agreement.”

15.In the case of Bharat Broadband Network Limited (Supra), it is
observed that Sub-section (5) of Section 12 read with Seventh Schedule
made it clear that if the arbitrator falls in any one of the categories
specified in the Seventh Schedule, he becomes ‘ineligible’ to act as an
arbitrator. It is further observed that once he becomes ‘ineligible’, it is clear
that he then become dejure unable to perform his functions inasmuch as
in law, he is regarded as ‘ineligible’. It further is observed in the said
decision that where a person becomes ineligible to be appointed as an
arbitrator there is no question of challenge to such arbitrator before such
arbitrator in such a case i.e. a case which falls under Section 14(1)(a) of
the Act gets attracted inasmuch as the arbitrator becomes, as a matter of
law (i.e., de jure), unable to perform his functions under Section 12(5),
being ineligible to be appointed as an arbitrator and this being so, his
mandate automatically terminates, and he shall then be substituted by
another arbitrator.”

8.1 Inthe aforesaid decision, this Court also negatived the submission

that as the contractor participated in the arbitration proceedings before

19
the arbitrator therefore subsequently, he ought not to have approached
the High Court for appointment of a fresh arbitrator under Section 11 of
the Arbitration Act, 1996. After referring to the decision of this Court in
the case of Bharat Broadband Network Limited v. United Telecoms
Limited, reported in (2019) 5 SCC 755, it is observed and held in

paragraph 20 as under:

“20. Now so far as the submission on behalf of the petitioners
that the respondents participated in the arbitration proceedings
before the sole arbitrator - Chairman and therefore he ought not
to have approached the High Court for appointment of arbitrator
under Section 11 is concerned, the same has also no substance.
As held by this Court in the case of Bharat Broadband Network
Limited (Supra) there must be an ‘express agreement’ in writing
to satisfy the requirements of Section 12(5) proviso. In
paragraphs 15 & 20 it is observed and held as under:

“15. Section 12(5), on the other hand, is a new provision
which relates to the de jure inability of an arbitrator to act
as such. Under this provision, any prior agreement to the
contrary iS wiped out by the non-obstante clause in
Section 12(5) the moment any person whose relationship
with the parties or the counsel or the subject matter of the
dispute falls under the Seventh Schedule. The sub-section
then declares that such person shall be “ineligible” to be
appointed as arbitrator. The only way in which this
ineligibility can be removed is by the proviso, which again
iS a special provision which states that parties may,
Subsequent to disputes having arisen between them,
waive the applicability of Section 12(5) by an express
agreement in writing. What ts clear, therefore, is that
where, under any agreement between the parties, a
person falls within any of the categories set out in the
Seventh Schedule, he is, aS a matter of law, ineligible to
be appointed as an arbitrator. The only way in which this

20
ineligibility can be removed, again, in law, is that parties
may after disputes have arisen between them, waive the
applicability of this sub-section by an “express agreement
in writing”. Obviously, the “express agreement in writing”
has reference to a person who is interdicted by the
Seventh Schedule, but who is stated by parties (after the
disputes have arisen between them) to be a person in
whom they have faith notwithstanding the fact that such
person is interdicted by the Seventh Schedule.

XXX XXK XXX

20. This then brings us to the applicability of the proviso
to Section 12(5) on the facts of this case. Unlike Section 4
of the Act which deals with deemed waiver of the right to
object by conduct, the proviso to Section 12(5) will only
apply if subsequent to disputes having arisen between the
parties, the parties waive the applicability of sub-section
(5) of Section 12 by an express agreement in writing. For
this reason, the argument based on the analogy of Section
7 of the Act must also be rejected. Section 7 deals with
arbitration agreements that must be in writing, and then
explains that such agreements may be contained in
documents which provide a record of such agreements.
On the other hand, Section 12(5) refers to an “express
agreement in_~ writing”. The expression “express
agreement in writing” refers to an agreement made in
words as opposed to an agreement which is to be inferred
by conduct. Here, Section 9 of the Indian Contract Act,
1872 becomes important. It states:

“Q, Promises, express and implied.—In so far as a
proposal or acceptance of any promise is made in
words, the promise is said to be express. In so far as
such proposal or acceptance is made otherwise than
in words, the promise is said to be implied.” It is thus
necessary that there be an “express” agreement in
writing.

This agreement must be an agreement by which both
parties, with full knowledge of the fact that Shri Khan is

21
ineligible to be appointed as an arbitrator, still go ahead
and say that they have full faith and confidence in him to
continue as such. The facts of the present case disclose
no such express agreement. The appointment letter which
is relied upon by the High Court as indicating an express
agreement on the facts of the case is dated 17.01.2017.
On this date, the Managing Director of the appellant was
certainly not aware that Shri Khan could not be appointed
by him as Section 12(5) read with the Seventh Schedule
only went to the invalidity of the appointment of the
Managing Director himself as an arbitrator. Shri Khan's
invalid appointment only became clear after the
declaration of the law by the Supreme Court in 7RF
Ltd. (Supra) which, aS we have seen hereinabove, was
only on 03.07.2017. After this date, far from there being
an express agreement between the parties as to the
validity of Shri Khan's appointment, the appellant filed an
application on O7.10.2017 before the sole arbitrator,
bringing the arbitrator's attention to the judgment in 7RF
Ltd. (Supra) and asking him to declare that he has become
de jure incapable of acting as an arbitrator. Equally, the
fact that a statement of claim may have been filed before
the arbitrator, would not mean that there is an express
agreement in words which would make it clear that both
parties wish Shri Khan to continue as arbitrator despite
being ineligible to act as such. This being the case, the
impugned judgment is not correct when it applies Section
4, Section 7, Section 12(4), Section 13(2), and Section
16(2) of the Act to the facts of the present case, and goes
on to state that the appellant cannot be allowed to raise
the issue of eligibility of an arbitrator, having itself
appointed the arbitrator. The judgment under appeal is
also in correct in stating that there is an express waiver in
writing from the fact that an appointment letter has been
issued by the appellant, and a statement of claim has been
filed by the respondent before the arbitrator. The moment the
appellant came to know that Shri Khan's appointment itself would
be invalid, it filed an application before the sole arbitrator for
termination of his mandate.”

22
9. In view of the above and for the reasons stated hereinabove, the
impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court is contrary to
the law laid down by this Court in the cases of TRF (supra), Bharat
Broadband Network Limited (Supra) and the recent decision of this Court
in the case of Jaipur Zila Dugdh Utpadak Sahkari Sangh Limited (supra).
It is held that the earlier Arbitral Tribunal — Stationery Purchase
Committee comprising of Additional Secretary, Department of Revenue
as President and (i) Deputy Secretary, Department of Revenue, (il)
Deputy Secretary, General Administration Department, (lil) Deputy
Secretary, Department of Finance, (iv) Deputy Secretary/Under
Secretary, General Administration Department and (v) Senior Deputy
Controller of Head Office, Printing as Members, has lost its mandate by
operation of law in view of Section 12(5) read with Seventh Schedule
and a fresh arbitrator has to be appointed under the provisions of the
Arbitration Act, 1996. The impugned judgment and order passed by the
High Court is therefore unsustainable and deserves to be quashed and

set aside.

10. In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, the present
appeal succeeds. The impugned judgment and order passed by the

High Court of Madhya Pradesh dated 27.08.2021 passed in AC No.

100/2019 is hereby quashed and set aside and the application being AC
No. 100/2019 filed by the appellant herein before the High Court is
hereby allowed. It is declared that the earlier Arbitral Tribunal —
Stationery Purchase Committee comprising of Additional Secretary,
Department of Revenue as President and (i) Deputy Secretary,
Department of Revenue, (il) Deputy Secretary, General Administration
Department, (iil) Deputy Secretary, Department of Finance, (iv) Deputy
Secretary/Under Secretary, General Administration Department and (v)
Senior Deputy Controller of Head Office, Printing as Members are
ineligible to act/continue as arbitrators in view of sub-section (5) of
Section 12 read with Seventh Schedule of the Arbitration Act, 1996 and
therefore a fresh arbitrator under the provisions of the Arbitration Act,
1996 is to be appointed to adjudicate upon and resolve the dispute

between the parties.

11. Instead of remanding the matter to the High Court to name the
arbitrator, we appoint Justice Abhay Manohar Sapre, a former Judge of
this Court to act as an arbitrator to adjudicate upon/resolve the dispute
between the parties. We hope and trust that the learned arbitrator shall
conclude the arbitration proceedings and declare the award at the
earliest considering the fact that the dispute between the parties Is

pending since the year 2000. Both the parties shall appear before the

24
learned arbitrator, at the first instance, within a period of four weeks from
today. Acopy of this judgment shall be forwarded to the newly appointed

arbitrator.

12. The present appeal is accordingly allowed. However, in the facts

and circumstances of the case, there shall be no order as to costs.

CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION

CIVIL APPEAL NO(S).54 OF 2022
(Arising out of SLP(Civil) No(s). 28682 of 2019)

M/S. DURGA WELDING WORKS ....APPELLANT(S)

VERSUS

CHIEF ENGINEER, RAILWAY
ELECTRIFICATION, ALLAHABAD & ANR. __...... RESPONDENT(S)

JUDGMENT

Rastogi, J.

1. Leave granted.

2. The instant appeal has been filed assailing the order dated 26"

Sig
i

eason:
power under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act,

1996(hereinafter being referred to as “the Act”).

3. The seminal facts not in dispute are that the tender of the
appellant was accepted and the same was communicated by letter
dated 30 November, 2006 in reference to which a contract
agreement was executed between the parties containing clauses 63
and 64 of the general conditions of contract containing the clause of
arbitration for settlement of claims and/or disputes between the
parties. Since there were claims which could not be settled, the
appellant served a legal notice dated 3™ August, 2009 for
appointment of an Arbitrator and for settlement of claims.
Although, there was no express reference made of clauses 63 and
64 in the notice, but the pith and substance of the notice dated 3"°
August, 2009 was for settlement of disputes through the process of
arbitration in terms of the clause of arbitration under general
conditions of agreement which is a part of the contract agreement

executed between the parties.

4. It is not disputed that the notice dated 3™ August, 2009 was
duly served upon the respondents. It is alleged that since the

2
respondents failed to appoint an arbitrator pursuant to notice dated
3™ August 2009, Arbitration Petition(ARBP No. 61 of 2009) came to
be filed on 23™ October, 2009 in the High Court of Orissa for

appointment of an Arbitrator under Section 11(6) of the Act.

5. It reveals from the record that just after filing of the arbitration
petition, the appellant has completely forgotten of taking action in
furtherance thereto and it was never in notice of the respondents of

such petition being filed since no notice was served at any stage.

6. In the meanwhile, the respondents vide letter dated 28"
January, 2010, in response to the letter of the appellant dated 3"
August, 2009 asked the appellant to select two names from a panel

of four persons.

7. It is alleged that immediately thereafter, on 17 February
2010, Miscellaneous Case No. 4 of 2010 was filed in Arbitration
Petition No. 61 of 2009 seeking an order restraining the
respondents from appointing an Arbitrator and that application too
remained pending and no action was taken up by the appellant to
pursue either the Arbitration Petition No. 61 of 2009 or the

Miscellaneous Case No. 4 of 2010 before the High Court.
8. In the meanwhile, by letter dated 28° August 2010, two
officers from the panel suggested by the respondents were selected
by the appellant and in furtherance thereto, the respondents
constituted an Arbitration Tribunal by letter dated 24" September,
2010. The appellant thereafter appeared before the Arbitral
Tribunal on 25" October, 2010 and preferred statement of claim.
The respondents also submitted their statement of defence on 15"

November, 2010.

9. The appellant thereafter appeared before the Arbitral Tribunal
on 27" December, 2011 and submitted an application that the
Tribunal has not been nominated within the stipulated time and
hence, the constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal is not valid and
further submitted that the Tribunal should not proceed with the
arbitration proceedings. The fact still remains that the arbitration
petition filed by the appellant on 23™ October, 2009 has not seen
the light of the day except the fact that it was filed in the Registry of

the High Court.

10. Since the Arbitral Tribunal was constituted, with consent of
the appellant, the Tribunal proceeded with the arbitration

4
proceedings and since the appellant failed to participate despite the
opportunity being afforded, ex-parte award came to be passed on
21* June, 2013 rejecting the claim of the appellant. The fact is that
finally in the arbitration petition filed by the appellant, notices were
issued to the respondents by the High Court in the year 2016,
almost 3 years after passing of the ex-parte award dated 21* June,
2013. The High Court, taking note of such peculiar facts and
circumstances, dismissed the arbitration petition by an Order dated
26" July, 2019 with liberty to the appellant to submit its objections

under Section 34 or 37 of the Act, if so advised.

11. We have heard learned counsel for the parties and with their

assistance perused the material available on record.

12. The exposition of legal principles is indeed well settled by this
Court in Datar Switchgears Ltd. Vs. Tata Finance Ltd. & Anr.’

followed in Punj Lloyd Ltd. Vs. Petronet MHB Ltd.’ that once an
application under Section 11(6) of the Act has been filed for
appointment of an Arbitrator before the High Court, the
respondents forfeited their right to appoint an Arbitrator and the

1 2000(8) SCC 151
2 2006(2) SCC 638
High Court alone holds jurisdiction to appoint an Arbitrator in
exercise of power under Section 11(6) of the Act. Indisputedly, the
appointment of an Arbitrator was made by the respondents after
arbitration petition was filed by the appellant under Section 11(6) of

the Act in the Registry of the High Court on 23° October, 2009.

13. This Court cannot be oblivious of the peculiar facts and
circumstances brought to our notice that after filing of an
arbitration petition on 23° October 2009 in the Registry of the High
Court, the appellant completely slept over the matter and the
respondents were never served of any notice of the Arbitration
Petition (ARBP No. 61 of 2009) filed before the High Court of Orissa.
At the given time, when the respondents called upon the appellant
to suggest and select two names out of the panel of four for
constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal, the appellant vide letter dated
28 August, 2010 selected two officers from the panel suggested by
the respondents. Pursuant thereto, the Arbitral Tribunal was
constituted by the respondents vide letter dated 24° September,
2010 and the appellant thereafter appeared before the Arbitral

Tribunal on 25” October, 2010 and submitted his statement of
claim and in furtherance, statement of defence was submitted by

the respondents.

14. The fact still remains that except the letter being once sent by
the appellant on 27" December, 2011 informing of the arbitration
petition being filed under Section 11(6) of the Act before the High
Court, no steps were taken thereafter to pursue his arbitration
application and since the appellant had not participated before the
Arbitral Tribunal after filing of the statement of claim, ex-parte
award came to be passed by the Arbitral Tribunal on 21* June,
2013. It may be noticed that notices were issued for the first time
by the High Court of the arbitration petition filed by the appellant in
the year 2016 almost 3 years after passing of the ex-parte award

dated 21° June, 2013.

15. In the given facts and circumstances, the High Court was not
inclined to exercise its jurisdiction under Section 11(6) of the Act for
appointment of an Arbitrator and dismissed the petition by an
Order dated 26" July, 2019 with liberty to the appellant to submit
objections against the ex-parte award dated 21“ June, 2013 under

Section 34 or 37 of the Act, if so advised.
16. In our considered view, so far as the question of law is
concerned, certainly being settled that after the application has
been filed for appointment of an Arbitrator under Section 11(6) of
the Act, before the High Court the respondents forfeited their right
to appoint an Arbitrator under the clause of arbitration thereafter
but from the narration of facts which has been noticed by us, we
are of the view that no error was committed by the High Court in
dismissing the petition filed under Section 11(6) of the Act for

appointment of an Arbitrator by an Order dated 26" July, 2019.
17. Consequently, the appeal fails and accordingly dismissed.

18. Pending application(s), if any, stand disposed of.

CIVIL APPEAL NO. 3358 OF 2020

2a. The appellant in Civil Appeal No.3358 of 2020 claims to be
hundred per cent Export Oriented Unit® engaged in the
manufacture of goods falling under Chapter 30 of the Schedule to
the Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985 and for that purpose, the
appellant has a factory, inter alia, at Plot No.8A/2, 8B/2, 8-
8A/1/1, Kalwe, MIDC, Dighe, Navi Mumbai — 400708. Besides, the
appellant has another factory situated at Plot No. L-1, MIDC,

appellant had applied for refund of Terminal Excise Duty’? in

respect of excisable goods procured from its unit in DTA, as it did
in the past and was granted refund from time to time between
2006 and 2012. The instant refund application, however, came to
be disallowed, which decision is the subject matter of appeal before
this Court. It had been asserted that TED was paid by the DTA
Unit from where the goods in question were procured or supplied
to the appellant for its EOU during the relevant period. The
application for refund dated 20.04.2012 was accompanied by a
declaration given by the appellant that the appellant’s DTA Unit did
not claim benefit of TED refund supported by the disclaimer
certificate given by DTA Unit in that regard. The refund application
was required to be decided within 30 days of receipt of complete
application. As it was not so disposed of, the appellant requested
the Development Commissioner to intervene and do the needful.
The refund claim for the period between July 2012 and September
2012 was around Rs.1,90,47,437/- (Rupees One Crore Ninety Lakh
Forty-Seven Thousand Four Hundred and Thirty-Seven only) and
for the period between October 2012 and December 2012, it was
Rs.1,36,04,814/- (Rupees One Crore Thirty-Six Lakh Four

Thousand Eight Hundred and Fourteen only).

2b. In the meantime, a circular purported to be a policy circular
bearing No.16 (RE-2012/2009-14) dated 15.03.2013"' came to be
issued by the Director General of Foreign Trade” to clarify that no
refund of TED should be _ provided by the Office’ of
DGFT/Development Commissioners, as supplies made by DTA Unit
to EOU are ab initio exempted from payment of excise duty. The
Development Commissioner eventually rejected the refund claim
set forth by the appellant and informed the appellant in that regard

vide letter dated 01.04.2013.

2c. Resultantly, the appellant filed Writ Petition No.9312 of 2013
before the Bombay High Court challenging the legality and validity
of the stated policy circular issued by DGFT and_ two
communications of the Development Commissioner rejecting the

refund application submitted by the appellant.

2d. In the meantime, a notification bearing No.4(RE-2013)/2009-
2014 came to be issued by DGFT on 18.04.2013'°, notifying the

amendments made by the Central Government in Foreign Trade

13 for short, “said notification”

Policy, 2009-2014" in exercise of powers conferred by Section 5 of

the Foreign Trade (Development and Regulation) Act, 1992”.

2e. The stated writ petition preferred by the appellant came to be
disposed of on 23.09.2014 whilst directing the competent authority
to consider the refund claim of the appellant afresh after taking
into account all aspects of the matter and give fair opportunity to

the appellant.

2f. Pursuant to the remand _ order, the Development
Commissioner granted personal hearing, but eventually rejected
the TED refund claim of the appellant vide order bearing No.

SEEPZ-SEZ/W.P./TED/SANDOZ/314/2013-14 dated 06.01.2015.

2g. Feeling aggrieved by this decision, the appellant filed fresh
Writ Petition No.2927 of 2015 before the Bombay High Court
assailing the policy circular dated 15.03.2013 and order dated
06.01.2015 passed by the Development Commissioner. The
Bombay High Court negatived the challenge to the stated policy
circular as well as the order passed by the Development

Commissioner and thus, dismissed the writ petition vide impugned

14 for short, “FTP”
15 for short, “1992 Act”
6

judgment and order dated 01.08.2016. This judgment is subject
matter of challenge in Civil Appeal No.3358 of 2020. By the same
judgment, the Bombay High Court dismissed the writ petition filed
by the appellant in Civil Appeal No.3359 of 2020 involving the self-

same issue.

CIVIL APPEAL NO. 3359 OF 2020

3a. Reverting to the factual matrix in Civil Appeal No.3359 of
2020, the appellant claims to be identically placed as in the
companion appeal being hundred per cent EOU engaged in
manufacturing of goods falling under Chapter 30 of the Schedule
to the Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985 and for that purpose, the
appellant has a factory at B-15, Phase 1-A, Verna, Salcette, Goa -
403772. The appellant’s DTA Unit has been supplying goods on
payment of CENVAT duty under claim for rebate to the appellant’s
EOU. The appellant’s EOU uses the said goods in the manufacture
of goods cleared for export. The appellant asserted that its DTA
Unit did not claim benefit of TED refund and produced disclaimer

certificate in that regard to enable the appellant’s EOU to claim the
7

refund of TED on the goods procured by it or supplied by its DTA
Unit. The appellant asserts that even in the past it had claimed
refund of TED paid by its DTA Unit on the goods supplied to the
appellant's EOU and was so granted by the Development
Commissioner. However, on this occasion, a different view had
been taken in respect of subject application dated 08.08.2012
submitted by the appellant for TED refund for the month of
November 2011 being Rs.6,87,89,737/- (Rupees Six Crore Eighty-
Seven Lakh Eighty-Nine Thousand Seven Hundred and Thirty-
Seven only). The claim came to be rejected in light of the policy
(impugned) circular issued by DGFT, without giving any

opportunity to the appellant.

3b. Feeling aggrieved, the appellant filed Writ Petition No.9607 of
2013 before the Bombay High Court challenging the legality and
validity of the policy circular dated 15.03.2013. That petition was
disposed of by directing the competent authority to pass a speaking
order on the refund application submitted by the appellant.
Pursuant to the remand order, the competent authority gave
personal hearing to the appellant and once again rejected the TED

refund claim vide order dated 12.01.2015 on the ground that the
8

appellant had received supplies of the concerned goods from their
DTA Unit to EOU, which were ab initio exempted from payment of
duty under para 6.11(c)(ii) of Foreign Trade Policy, 2009-2014.

Thus, refund was not admissible to the appellant.

3c. This decision was challenged by the appellant before the
Bombay High Court by way of fresh Writ Petition No.2926 of 2015
wherein the policy circular dated 15.03.2013 issued by DGFT was
also challenged. This writ petition was heard and decided by the
Bombay High Court, along with another writ petition (which is
subject matter in the companion appeal filed by Sandoz Private
Limited) vide common judgment and order dated 01.08.2016,
rejecting the assail to the policy circular and order passed by the
competent authority referred to above. This judgment is subject

matter of challenge in Civil Appeal No. 3359 of 2020.

4. As the factual matrix in both the writ petitions was similar,
the High Court vide common impugned judgment dated
01.08.2016 considered the grounds of challenge to the decision of
the Development Commissioner; and eventually opined that in light

of paras 6.2(b) and 6.11(c)(ii) of the FTP, no refund of TED could be
9

given by the regional authority of DGFT or the Office of the
Development Commissioners because procurement of excisable
goods by the appellants-EOUs was ab initio exempted from
payment of excise duty. It went on to observe that there was a
clear stipulation in the FTP itself in that regard. The High Court
noted that the purport of the impugned circular was only to clarify
the obvious position. There was no obligation on the EOU to pay
duty at the time of procurement of excisable goods. For, FTP
plainly predicates that the procurement of excisable goods should
be done by EOU without payment of excise duty. As there is
reverse obligation on EOU to procure excisable goods without
payment of duty, there is no question of claiming refund. Thus, it
held that the conclusion reached by the Development
Commissioner was in conformity with the dispensation provided in
the FTP and is not in any manner contrary thereto or to the
mandate of Section 5 of the 1992 Act. Further, the impugned
circular was only to place on record the correct perspective of the
dispensation provided in the FTP. The argument that the
impugned circular can have prospective effect only, cannot be

countenanced in law. In that, the circular was only to clarify the
10

purport of paras 6.2(b), 6.11(c)(ii) and 8.3(c) of the FTP; and if these
provisions were read harmoniously and conjointly, leave no
manner of doubt that refund request before DGFT under para
8.3(c) in relation to excisable goods, even though procured by EOU

upon payment of duty, would be inadmissible in law.

5. The Bombay High Court also noted that although in the past
the regional authority had accepted refund request of EOUs, that
cannot bestow any right much less vested right in EOUS so as to
issue mandamus to the concerned statutory authorities to act
contrary to the provisions of the FTP. As a matter of fact, to dispel
the doubt entertained by EOUs if any, the position was restated by
the Government vide notification dated 18.04.2013 issued in
exercise of power conferred under Section 5 of the 1992 Act. In
substance, the Bombay High Court observed that the impugned
circular was only to restate and clarify that the regional authority
of DGFT was not competent to entertain the refund application;
and if EOU or the supplier so desired, were free to pursue refund
claim before the competent excise authorities where amount

towards duty had been deposited or paid.
11

CIVIL APPEAL NO.3360 OF 2020

6a. This appeal by the Union of India assails the judgment and
order dated 08.10.2018 passed by the Division Bench of the High
Court of Delhi in Writ Petition (C) No.10526 of 2017. By that writ
petition, the respondent claiming to be a “supplier” of excisable
goods to various EOUs, who in turn exported their final product
outside India, sought direction against DGFT to grant TED refund
in the sum of Rs.46,54,295 (Rupees Forty-Six Lakh Fifty-Four
Thousand Two Hundred and Ninety-Five only), towards deemed
exports made to EOUs (Vimal Agro Products Pvt. Ltd. and TATA
Coffee Ltd.). These supplies were made between January 2012 and

March 2013 and admittedly, before issue of the impugned circular.

6b. The respondent-Company (DTA Unit) had filed refund
application before the Joint Director General of Foreign Trade,
which was returned to it in light of the impugned circular. The
appellant then pursued the refund application on 11.03.2014 to
the Deputy Commissioner of Central Excise Department, which
came to be rejected on 29.05.2015. Against this decision, the

matter was carried in appeal up to the Customs Excise and Service
12

Tax Appellate Tribunal'’® unsuccessfully. After exhausting that
remedy and allowing decision of the statutory authorities under the
Central Excise Act, 1944" as final, the respondent-Company chose
to file writ petition before the High Court of Delhi seeking direction
against DGFT to consider the refund application regarding TED
amount under FTP. It was urged that the primary responsibility to
refund TED amount paid by the respondent-Company (DTA Unit)
being supplier of excisable goods to EOU, was that of DGFT. The
High Court of Delhi vide impugned judgment dated 08.10.2018
allowed the writ petition and issued directions to DGFT to consider
the refund application filed by the respondent-Company and if
found in order, directed refund of TED amount to the respondent

with interest at the rate of 9 % per annum. The High Court of
Delhi essentially relied upon its earlier decision in Kandoi Metal
Powders Manufacturing Company Private Limited vs. Union of
India’ which in turn had adverted to the decision of the Calcutta
High Court in the case of Joint Director General of Foreign
Trade vs. IFGL Refractories Limited’’, to reinforce the view
16 for short, “the CESTAT”

17 for short, “1944 Act”

18 (2014) 302 ELT 209 (Del.)
19 2002 (143) ELT 294 (Cal.)
13

taken by it that the impugned circular invoked by the Department
had prospective effect only. It also noted that Kandoi Metal

Powders Manufacturing Company Private Limited’° was
concerned with the clarification issued by the Policy Interpretation
Committee vide its decision dated 04.12.2012 to the effect that
refund of CENVAT credit provisions were available under the
Central Excise Act and the Rules framed thereunder. The same
should be availed instead of claiming refund. It was held that the
view taken by DGFT that the respondent could avail of the refund
under the provisions of the 1944 Act and the Rules framed
thereunder, was untenable in law. On facts, it noted that since the
supply of excisable goods was prior to 15.03.2013, the question of
invoking circular against the respondent-Company did not arise.
Instead, the High Court held that refund application ought to have
been processed by the DGFT in terms of para 8.3(c) of the FTP, as
it stood prior to 15.03.2013. Accordingly, while allowing the writ
petition, the High Court of Delhi issued direction to the appellant
(DGFT) to consider the respondent’s refund application and to

refund the due amount with interest at the rate of 9 % per annum.

CIVIL APPEAL NO.3705 OF 2020

7. This appeal by Union of India is against the decision dated
09.12.2019 of the Division Bench of the High Court of Karnataka
in Writ Appeal No.286 of 2019 (T-TAR). The stated appeal was filed
by the appellant-Union of India by way of intra-court appeal
against the decision dated 20.3.2018”' of the learned Single Judge
of the same High Court in Acer India Put. Ltd. vs. Union of India
[Writ Petition No.64539 of 2016 (T-TAR)] whereby the respondent-
Company — claiming to be engaged in the business of manufacture
and sale of computer systems and supply of goods to hundred per
cent EOUs on payment of TED, had sought a declaration that it
was eligible for refund of TED amount in respect of goods supplied
to EOUs during the period from June 2009 to October 2009 in
terms of para 8.3 of the FTP. Learned Single Judge of the High

Court of Karnataka adverted to the decision of the learned Single
Judge of the Calcutta High Court in IFGL Refractories Limited
vs. Joint Director General of Foreign Trade”? (later confirmed by

the Division Bench of the same High Court in Joint Director

21 2018 (361) ELT 44 (Kar.)
22 2001 (132) ELT 545 (Cal.)
15

General of Foreign Trade*’) and of the High Court of Delhi in
Kandoi Metal Powders Manufacturing Company Private

Limited** wherein it had been held that once the supply of goods
fall within the category of deemed exports, the unit would be

entitled to refund of TED. Learned Single Judge also adverted to
the decision of the Madras High Court in Lenovo (India) Put. Ltd.
vs. Union of India” and to the decision of the Bombay High Court

in case of Sandoz Private Limited which is impugned in the
cognate appeals referred to above. Learned Single Judge, however,
noted that the decision of the Bombay High Court has been
distinguished by the Madras High Court, but then went on to
observe that it did not agree with the view taken by the Bombay
High Court in view of the amendment to the FTP. Instead, learned
Single Judge opined that the policy circular dated 15.03.2013, by
no standard, was clarificatory in nature. Resultantly, learned
Single Judge allowed the writ petition and was pleased to set aside
the communication dated 31.03.2016 issued by the Deputy
Director of Foreign Trade, disallowing the refund claim of the

23 supra at Footnote No.19
24 supra at Footnote No.18
25 (2017) 346 ELT 12 (Mad.)
16

respondent-Company (DTA Unit). Learned Single Judge while
setting aside that order relegated the respondent-Company before
the competent authority under the FTP to consider the refund
claim of the respondent-Company in accordance with the policy.
The Division Bench whilst dealing with the appeal filed by the
Department, vide impugned judgment noted that the respondent-
Company had supplied computer systems to EOU on payment of
TED from June 2009 till October 2009, which in terms of the FTP,
in particular para 8.2(b), was deemed export — entitling the
respondent-Company to claim refund of TED from the regional
authority of DGFT in terms of para 8.3(c) of the FTP. The Division
Bench of the High Court of Karnataka opined that there was no
infirmity in the view taken by the learned Single Judge holding that
the appellant cannot be heard to retain the amount which was not
payable by way of tax being a case of deemed export. As the
amount of Rs.1,04,36,945 (Rupees One Crore Four Lakh Thirty-Six
Thousand Nine Hundred and Forty-Five only) was wrongly paid by
the respondent-Company, the same needed to be refunded and,

therefore, learned Single Judge was justified in relegating the
17

respondent-Company before the competent authority under the

FTP to consider the refund claim.

8. We have heard Shri Arvind Datar, Shri Jay Savla, learned
senior counsel and Shri Prakash Shah, learned counsel appearing
for the appellants in the appeals by the Assessee, Shri Balbir
Singh, learned Additional Solicitor General of India for the
Department; and Shri G. Shivadass, learned senior counsel for the
respondent-Assessee (writ petitioner), in the appeals by the

Department.

CONSIDERATION

9. From the factual matrix delineated above in the respective
appeals, it is obvious that Civil Appeal Nos.3358 and 3359 of 2020
pertain to EOUs, who had “procured” goods from its unit in
Domestic Tariff Area (DTA), which transactions were in the nature
of deemed export by the DTA Unit to EOU within the meaning of
the applicable FTP. On the other hand, the appeals against the
decision of the High Court of Delhi and the High Court of

Karnataka pertain to the refund claim set up by the DTA Unit —
18

“suppliers” of goods to concerned EOU, also in reference to self-

same Foreign Trade Policy (FTP).

10. The moot question is: whether the entities herein are entitled
to refund of amount purportedly towards TED in respect of
specified goods procured or supplied, as the case may be, being
deemed exports and from which authority, either under applicable
Foreign Trade Policy (FTP) or the 1944 Act? Further, whether
Circular No.16 (RE-2012/2009-14) dated 15.03.2013 is merely
clarificatory regarding TED refund and exemption and the efficacy

thereof?

11. The claim for refund of TED amount of the concerned entities
being the recipient or the supplier of specified goods, as the case
may be, needs to be understood and analysed in two broad silos
and in the context of nature of transaction and the applicability of
the provisions of the concerned laws, namely, FTP propounded
under the 1992 Act and the 1944 Act. We will dilate on this aspect
at appropriate place. Be it noted that the refund claim in the
respective appeals varies between June 2009 and March 2013 (i.e.,

Civil Appeal No.3358 of 2020 — July 2012 and December 2012;
19

Civil Appeal No.3359 of 2020 — November 2011; Civil Appeal
No.3360 of 2020 — January 2012 and March 2013; and Civil

Appeal No.3705 of 2020 — June 2009 and October 2009).

12. At the outset, it needs to be borne in mind that the entities in
all these cases are claiming refund founded on the FTP and not in
reference to the provisions of the 1944 Act or the rules framed
thereunder, in particular, the Central Excise Rules, 2002”° and the

CENVAT Credit Rules, 20047’.

13. Had it been a claim for refund of duty under the 1944 Act, the
same would be governed by the regime predicated in Section 11B of
that Act. The expression “duty” has been defined in Rule 2(e) of
the 2002 Rules to mean the duty payable under Section 3 of the
1944 Act. Section 3 of the 1944 Act envisages that there shall be
levied and collected in such manner as may be prescribed a duty of
excise as may be called the Central Value Added Tax (CENVAT) on
all excisable goods (excluding goods produced or manufactured in
special economic zones) which are produced or manufactured in

India as, and at the rates, set forth in the Fourth Schedule. It may

26 for short, “2002 Rules”
27 for short, “2004 Rules”
20

be apposite to refer to Section 5A” of the 1944 Act. It empowers
the Central Government to grant exemption from duty of excise in
respect of specified excisable goods. The exercise of power to
exempt is a beneficial power — which enables the Central
Government to reduce or waive duty on specified goods on such
conditions as may be prescribed. The exemption notification has
statutory force. However, the manufacturers (including DTA Unit)
of specified goods are free to disregard, the benefit of exemption so
provided when it is laced with fulfilment of pre-conditions by third

party (EOU). However, sub-section (1A) of Section 5A came to be

28 5A. Power to grant exemption from duty of excise.— (1) If the Central Government is
satisfied that it is necessary in the public interest so to do, it may, by notification in the
Official Gazette, exempt generally either absolutely or subject to such conditions (to be
fulfilled before or after removal) as may be specified in the notification, excisable goods
of any specified description from the whole or any part of the duty of excise leviable
thereon:

Provided that, unless specifically provided in such notification, no exemption therein
shall apply to excisable goods which are produced or manufactured—

() in a free trade zone or a special economic zone and brought to any other
place in India; or

(i) by a hundred per cent. export-oriented undertaking and brought to any
other place in India.

Explanation. —In this proviso, “free trade zone”, “special economic zone” and “hundred
per cent. export-oriented undertaking” shall have the same meanings as in Explanation 2 to
sub-section (1) of Section 3.

(1-A) For the removal of doubts, it is hereby declared that where an exemption
under sub-section (1) in respect of any excisable goods from the whole of the duty of
excise leviable thereon has been granted absolutely, the manufacturer of such excisable
goods shall not pay the duty of excise on such goods.

(emphasis supplied)
21

inserted by way of an amendment w.e.f. 13.05.2005. It was for
removal of doubts. It declared that where an exemption under
sub-section (1) in respect of any excisable good from the whole of
the duty of excise leviable thereon has been granted absolutely, the
manufacturer of such excisable goods “shall not pay the duty of
excise on such goods”. This stipulation ordains that the excise
duty is not payable on the specified goods. However, this
stipulation will be attracted if the excise duty is exempted ab initio
(without any pre-condition). Be that as it may, the governing FTP
regime ought to prevail being a special dispensation under the

1992 Act.

14. The authorities propounding the FIP were obviously
conscious of the purport of the provisions of the 1944 Act and the
rules framed thereunder. Despite that, the subject policy had been
propounded with the sole objective of promoting exports and
earning foreign exchange. At the relevant time, the goal set forth
by the policy makers was to achieve the target of at least one per
cent of the global trade by promoting exports. It is thus clear that

the concessions or so to say, benefits and entithements provided
22

under the FTP cannot be constricted by the provisions of the taxing
statute of 1944 and the rules framed thereunder. To put it tersely,
the dispensation provided under the 1992 Act and the FTP must
operate independently and is thus mutually exclusive in this
regard. Taking any other view would be counter-productive and
whittle down the intent behind formulation of a liberal FTP for

promoting exports.

15. Under the subject FTP, Chapter 6 deals with EOUs,
Electronics Hardware Technology Parks (EHTPs), Software
Technology Parks (STPs) and Bio-Technology Parks (BTPs). Para
6.1 provides for the eligibility criterion. It envisages that units
undertaking to export their entire production of goods and services
(except permissible sales in DTA) may be set up under the EOU
Scheme. Similar provision is made regarding other Parks referred
to therein. It is, however, made clear that trading units are not
covered under these schemes. Para 6.1 (Eligibility) reads thus: -

“6.1 _ Eligibility

Units undertaking to export their entire production of
goods and services (except permissible sales in DTA), may
be set up under the Export Oriented Unit (EOU) Scheme,
Electronics Hardware Technology Park (EHTP) Scheme,
Software Technology Park (STP) Scheme or _ Bio-
23

Technology Park (BTP) Scheme for manufacture of goods,
including repair, re-making, reconditioning,  re-
engineering and rendering of services. Trading units are
not covered under these schemes.”

16. Para 6.2 of the FTP specifies the stipulations for the EOU to
conduct its activities such as export and import of goods. Amongst
others, the clause relevant for considering the present appeals is

para 6.2(b), which reads thus: -

“6.2 Export and Import of Goods

(b) An EOU/EHTP/STP/BTP unit may import and/or
procure, from DTA or bonded warehouses in
DTA/international exhibition held in India, without
payment of duty, all types of goods, including capital
goods, required for its activities, provided they are not
prohibited items of import in the ITC (HS). Any
permission required for import under any other law
shall be applicable. Units shall also be permitted to
import goods including capital goods required for
approved activity, free of cost or on loan/lease from
clients. Import of capital goods will be on a self-
certification basis. Goods imported by a unit shall be
with actual user condition and shall be utilized for
export production.

(emphasis supplied)

From the opening part of this provision itself, it is amply clear that
it governs specified entities/units, who are engaged in import
and/or procurement of goods from DTA or bonded warehouses etc.,
and that they must do so without payment of duty. Besides, the

specified entities are obliged to utilise the goods imported with
24

actual user condition and to be used or utilised for export
production. This twin condition must be complied by the specified
entities without any exception for deriving benefit or availing of
entitlements under FTP. Chapter 6 of the FTP postulates that
supply of goods from DTA Units to EOU must be regarded as
deemed exports, as is evident from para 6.11 of the FTP. The same

reads thus: -

“6.11 Entitlement for supplies from the DTA

(a) Supplies from DTA to
EOU/EHTP/STP/BTP units will be regarded as
“deemed exports” and DTA supplier shall be
eligible for relevant entitlements under
chapter 8 of FTP, besides discharge of export
obligation, if any, on the © supplier.
Notwithstanding the above, EOU/EHTP/STP/
BTP units shall, on production of a suitable
disclaimer from DTA supplier, be eligible for
obtaining entitlements specified in chapter 8
of FTP. For claiming deemed export duty
drawback, they shall get brand rates fixed by DC
wherever All Industry Rates of Drawback are not
available.

(b) Suppliers of precious and semi-precious
stones, synthetic stones and processed pearls
from DTA to EOU shall be eligible for grant of
Replenishment Authorisations at rates and for
items mentioned in HBP v1.

(c) In addition, EOU/EHTP/STP/BIP units
shall be entitled to following: -

(i) Reimbursement of Central Sales Tax
(CST) on goods manufactured in India.
25

Simple interest @ 6% per annum will be
payable on delay in refund of CST, if the
case is not settled within 30 days of
receipt of complete application (as in
paragraph 9.10.1 of HBP v1).

(ii) Exemption from payment of
Central Excise Duty on goods procured
from DTA on goods manufactured in
India.

(iii) Reimbursement of duty paid on fuel
procured from domestic oil
companies/Depots of domestic oil Public
Sector Undertakings as per drawback rate
notified by DGFT from time to time.
Reimbursement of additional duty of
excise levied on fuel under the Finance
Acts would also be admissible.

(iv) CENVAT Credit on service tax paid.”
(emphasis supplied)

The opening part of clause (a) concerns the supplier as it refers to
supplies from DTA Unit to EOU to be regarded as deemed exports.
Further, as a consequence of deemed exports, DTA supplier
becomes eligible for entitlements specified under Chapter 8 of the
FTP. To put it differently, in the same Chapter 6, the entitlement of
DTA supplier under Chapter 8 of FTP has also been adverted to.
This provision also deals with the manner of availing the
entitlements specified under Chapter 8 of FTP — either by the DTA
Unit itself or the EOU, the recipient of the goods and services. For,
in terms of this stipulation even the EOU can set up a refund claim

in respect of stated transaction, in lieu of the entitlement of DTA
26

Unit after obtaining suitable disclaimer from DTA supplier. In
other words, clause 6.11 [clause (a) thereof in particular] deals with
entitlement of DTA supplier, which can be availed by the DTA
supplier itself or by the EOU to whom the goods were supplied by it
upon giving suitable disclaimer in that regard. The entitlements of
the DTA supplier have been delineated in Chapter 8 of FTP, to
which we will advert to a little later. Clause (a) of Chapter 6.11
also provides that DTA supplier and EOU may claim deemed export
duty drawback as well, as per the rates fixed by DC wherever All

Industry Rates of Drawback are not available.

17. Clause (c) of para 6.11 is a provision which spells out the
entitlement of EOU. It includes reimbursement of Central Sales
Tax (CST) on goods manufactured in India; exemption from
payment of Central Excise Duty on goods produced from DTA on
goods manufactured in India; reimbursement of duty paid on fuel
procured from domestic oil companies/depots of domestic oil
public sector undertakings as per drawback rate notified by DGFT
from time to time; and lastly, CENVAT Credit on service tax paid.
As regards the Central Excise Duty, para 6.11(c)(ii) postulates

exemption from payment of Central Excise Duty on goods procured
27

by the EOU from DTA on goods manufactured in India. This is in
consonance with the stipulation in para 6.2(b), which predicates
that the EOU may import goods from DTA without payment of

duty.

18. From the scheme of Chapter 6 of FTP, it is thus clear that the
EOU can import goods from DTA supplier, which transaction de
jure is treated as deemed export; and it can do so without payment
of duty, as it has been exempted vide para 6.11(c)(ii) of the FTP.

On its own, the EOU is not eligible for any other entitlement.

19. Needless to observe that there is marked distinction between

»30

the expression “benefit” and “entitlement’ “Benefit”, by its very

nature, is an advantage, help or aid, while “entitlement” is right to
have something. Under Chapter 6, the EOU is entitled to import
specified goods from DTA without payment of duty, subject to
fulfilling other requirements including of actual user condition and

to be utilised for export production, being a case of ab initio

29 In Black’s Law Dictionary (11 Edition): benefit, n. (14c) 1. The advantage or privilege
something gives; the helpful or useful effect something has <the benefit of owning a car>. 2.
Profit or gain; esp., the consideration that moves to the promise <a benefit received from the
sale>. — Also termed legal benefit; legal value.

30 In Black’s Law Dictionary (11 Edition): entitlement. (19c) An absolute right to a (usu.
monetary) benefit, such as social security, granted immediately upon meeting a legal
requirement.
28

exemption qua EOU. The provision in the form of para 6.1 1(a)
merely enables EOU to set up a claim “in respect of” entitlements
of DTA supplier under Chapter 8 of FTP. There is no separate
entitlement for EOU under Chapter 8 of FTP. To put it differently,
although the heading of para 6.11 is “Entitlement for supplies from
the DTA” and clause (a) thereof envisages that EOU shall on
production of a suitable disclaimer from DTA supplier be eligible
for obtaining entitlements specified in Chapter 8 of FTP, it does not
follow that it is the entitlement of EOU. It is, however, only a case
of benefit transferred to EOU concerning the entitlement of DTA

supplier under Chapter 8 of FTP.

20. That brings us to Chapter 8 of FTP. The heading of Chapter 8
is “Deemed Exports”. The original para 8.1 specified that deemed
exports refer to those transactions in which goods supplied do not
leave country and payment for such supplies is received either in
Indian rupees or in free foreign exchange. By way of amendment,
it further provided that the supply of specified goods (noted in para
8.2) shall be regarded as deemed exports provided goods are

manufactured in India. The original para 8.1 reads thus: -
29

“8.1. Deemed Exports

“Deemed Exports” refer to those transactions in which
goods supplied do not leave country, and payment for
such supplies is received either in Indian rupees or in free
foreign exchange.”

[Para 8.1, after amendment, in 2012-2013 reads thus: -
“8.1. Deemed Exports

Deemed Exports” refer to those transactions in which
goods supplied do not leave country, and payment for
such supplies is received either in Indian rupees or in
free foreign exchange. Supply of goods as mentioned
in Paragraph 8.2 below shall be regarded as
“Deemed Exports” provided goods are
manufactured in India.”]

(amendment highlighted)

Para 8.2 of Chapter 8 specifies the categories of supplies which can
be regarded as deemed exports. Clause (b) thereof is applicable to
the present appeals. Relevant extract of original para 8.2 is as

under: -

“8.2. Categories of Supply

Following categories of supply of goods by main/sub-
contractors shall be regarded as “Deemed Exports” under
FTP, provided goods are manufactured in India:

(a) xxx XXX XXX

(b) Supply of goods to EOU/STP/EHTP/BTP;

[Para 8.2, after amendment, in 2012-2013 reads thus: -
“8.2. Categories of Supply

Following categories of supply of goods by main/sub-
contractors shall be regarded as “Deemed Exports”:
30

(c) xxx XXX XXX

(d) Supply of goods to EOU/STP/EHTP/BTP;

In other words, only the specified categories of supplies are
regarded as deemed exports. In that, import of goods, as specified
in para 8.2(b) from DTA supplier to the EOU is regarded as deemed
exports. To put it differently, the supply of goods by DTA Unit to
EOU with actual user condition and utilised for export production,
are regarded as deemed exports.

benefits have been extended, as provided in para 8.3 of the FTP

applicable at the relevant time, which reads thus:

“8.3 Benefits for Deemed Exports

Deemed exports shall be eligible for any/all of following
benefits in respect of manufacture and supply of goods
qualifying as deemed exports subject to terms and
conditions as in HBP v1:-

To such transactions, certain

certified by an officer not below rank of Joint
Secretary to Government of India in Department
of Atomic Energy, shall be entitled for deemed
export benefits in cases where procedure of
competitive bidding (and not ICB) has been
followed.

(emphasis supplied)

Though couched as benefits, these are essentially entitlements, to
be availed by DTA supplier in terms of para 8.4.2. As noted earlier,
in terms of para 6.1ll(a), the EOU can also avail of those
entitlements of DTA as specified in Chapter 8 of FTP, as had been
earmarked for DTA supplier. That does not mean that EOU is
eligible for those entitlements, on its own accord as, amongst other,
it is obliged to obtain disclaimer from DTA supplier as a

precondition.
35

21. As aforementioned, para 8.2 lists the categories of supply of
goods which are regarded as deemed exports including supply of
goods to EOU [para 8.2 (b)]. The specified transactions are
provided certain benefits mentioned in para 8.3, subject to terms
and conditions in the handbook procedures, volume I, published
under FTP. Para 8.3(c), inter alia, envisages that exemption from
TED is available for supplies made against International
Competitive Bidding’’ and also to Advance Authorisation Holder to
a manufacturer holding another advance authorisation if such
manufacturer supplies the products to an ultimate exporter. In
other cases, (would include other DTA suppliers of goods to EOU),
however, refund of TED will be given. Further, the expression
“will” is to be construed as a mandate to give refund to such DTA
suppliers, being its entithkement under FTP. This does not whittle
down the ab initio exemption of payment of duty given to EOU in

respect of supply from DTA.

22. Notably, para 8.3(c) of FTP does not provide in-built eligibility
“category” unlike specified in sub-paras (a) and (b) for ICB and
Advance Authorisation Holder. The expression “in other cases” in

31 for short, “ICB”
36

sub-para (c) needs to be understood in proper perspective.
Concededly, paras 8.4.1 to 8.4.7 provide for benefits to the supplier
of goods to EOU as being deemed export. It is essentially an
entitlement of DTA supplier — as listed in para 8.3(a), (b) and (c) of
FTP, as may be applicable. It is seen that para 8.4.2 was
substituted by the revised FTP of 2012, wherein a table was

inserted*’. As per that table, benefits available under para 8.2 to

32 Para 8.4, after amendment, in 2012-2013 reads thus:-

facility/rebate has not been availed by applicant. Such
supplies will however be eligible for deemed export
drawback on customs duty paid on
inputs/components.

[Para 8.5, after amendment, in 2012-2013 reads thus:-

“8.5 Eligibility for refund of terminal excise
duty/drawback

Supply of goods will be eligible for refund of
terminal excise duty in terms of Para 8.3(c) of FTP,
provided recipient of goods does not avail CENVAT
credit/rebate on such goods. A declaration to this
effect, in Annexure II of ANF 8, from recipient of
goods, shall be submitted by applicant. Similarly,
supplies will be eligible for deemed export drawback
in terms of para 8.3 (b) of FTP of Central Excise
duty paid on  inputs/components, provided
CENVAT credit /rebate has not been availed of
such duty paid by supplier of goods. A
declaration to this effect, in Annexure III of ANF
8, from supplier of goods, shall be submitted by
applicant. Such supplies shall however be eligible
for deemed export drawback on customs duty paid
on inputs/components.

(amendments highlighted)

8.5.1 Simple interest @ 6% per annum will be payable
on delay in refund of duty drawback and terminal
excise duty under deemed export scheme, if the case is
not settled within 30 days of receipt of complete
application (as in paragraph 9.10.1 of HBP v1).”

24. Similarly, benefit under para 8.3(b) of FTP regarding deemed
export drawback can be availed, provided CENVAT credit/rebate
has not been availed by DTA supplier and subject to complying

other formalities. Para 8.4.2 as originally stood, is indicative of
39

option given only to supplier (DTA) in connection with supply of
goods to EOU, as specified in para 8.3 (a), (b) and (c) of FTP. That
has remained intact despite the amendment of 2012, until March
2013. Be it noted that the purport of para 8.5 states that supply of
goods will be eligible for TED refund only if CENVAT credit/rebate
has not been availed on such_ goods. These stipulations
demonstrate that the scheme of FTP is explicit and not ambiguous
nor silent in respect of benefits and entitlements of the concerned
entities. It needs no elaboration. Thus, an argument having
potential of defeating the intent of the applicable FTP, in any

manner, ought to be negated.

25. Going by the scheme of FTP applicable at the relevant period,
it is crystal clear that EOUs were entitled to ab initio exemption
from payment of Central Excise duty on goods procured from DTA
on goods manufactured in India, as the import of such goods was
to be made without payment of duty. No more and no less. That,
however, did not preclude the EOU from availing of the entitlement
of DTA supplier under Chapter 8 upon obtaining a suitable

disclaimer from DTA supplier, as provided in para 6.11(a). That
40

availment by EOU had been linked to entitlement of DTA supplier,
as specified in Chapter 8. The DTA supplier could (entitled to) take
refund of TED in respect of goods supplied by it to EOU being
exempted from TED, in light of para 8.3(c). The eligibility for
refund of TED, however, has been circumscribed by formalities and
requirements to be adhered to, including as noted in para 8.5. In
that, recipient of goods (EOU) does not avail CENVAT credit or
rebate. Similarly, DTA supplier would be eligible for deemed export
drawback in terms of para 8.3(b) of FTP on Central Excise paid on
inputs/components, provided CENVAT credit facility/rebate has

not been availed.

26. Upon conjoint reading of the relevant para and its clauses, it
leaves no manner of doubt that the intent of the subject FTP was to
encourage DTA suppliers by providing refund of TED in terms of
para 8.3(c), subject to fulfilment of formalities and stipulations in
Chapter 8 of FTP. This was also to generate foreign exchange as a
consequence of goods supplied as inputs or otherwise, were finally
exported by the EOU. The EOU, on the other hand, could only
avail of the entitlement of the DTA supplier if the DTA supplier had

not taken rebate or CENVAT credit facility (as per para 8.5) treating
41

it as deemed export. This dispensation was uniformly followed
until the issue of policy circular dated 15.3.2013. That circular

reads thus:-

“Government of India
Ministry of Commerce and Industry
Directorate General of Foreign Trade

Udyog Bhawan, New Delhi

Policy Circular No. 16 (RE-2012/2009-14)
Dated: 15 March, 2013

To,
All Regional Authorities
All Development Commissioners, SEZ.

Subject: Clarification regarding TED Refund where TED
exemption is available.

It has come to the notice of this Directorate that
some RAs of DGFT and the Officers of Development
Commissioners of SEZ are providing refund of TED even
in those cases where supplies of goods, under deemed
exports, is ab-initio exempted.

2. There are three categories of supplies where supply of
goods, under deemed exports, are ab-initio exempted
from payment of excise duties. These are as follows:

(i) Supply of goods under Invalidation letter issued
against Advance Authorisation [Para 8.3(c) of
FTP];

(ii) | Supply of goods under ICB [Para 8.3(c) of FTP];
and

(iii) Supply of goods to EOUs [Para 6.11(c)(ii) of FTP]
42

3. Prudent financial management and adherence to
discipline of budget would be compromised if refund is
provided, in cases, where exemption is mandated. In fact,
in such cases the relevant taxes should not have been
collected to begin with. And if, there has been an
error/oversight committed, then the agency
collecting the tax would refund it, rather than seeking
reimbursement from another agency. Accordingly, it is
clarified that in respect of supplies, as stated at Para 2
above, no refund of TED should be provided by RAs of
DGFT/Office of Development Commissioners, because
such supplies are ab-initio exempted from payment of
excise duty.

4. This issue with the approval of DGFT.

Joint Director of Foreign Trade

33 Section 5, as it existed before amendment in 2010:

5. Export and import policy. — The Central Government may, from time to time
formulate and announce, by notification in the Official Gazette, the export and import policy
and may also, in the like manner, amend that policy.

Section 5, as substituted by Act 25 of 2010 w.e.f. 27.8.2010:

5. Foreign Trade Policy. — The Central Government may, from time to time,
formulate and announce, by notification in the Official Gazette, the foreign trade policy and
may also, in like manner, amend that policy:

Provided that the Central Government may direct that, in respect of the Special
Economic Zones, the foreign trade policy shall apply to the goods, services and
technology with such exceptions, modifications and adaptations, as may be specified by
it by notification in the Official Gazette.
44

27. As regards the claim for refund of TED by EOU, therefore,
need to be governed by the dispensation provided in para 6.11(a)
read with entitlement of DTA supplier under Chapter 8 of FTP.
However, it may have to be processed by the authorities under the
FTP keeping in mind the principle underlying the refund of
CENVAT credit granted under Rule 5 of the 2004 Rules and in the
manner provided therefor, though not covered by Rule 5. That is
because in law it is a case of deemed export by virtue of applicable

FTP.

28. If the refund claim is by the EOU, the same needs to be
processed by the authorities under the FTP by reckoning the
entitlement of DTA supplier specified in Chapter 8 of the FTP
concerning the goods supplied to it, being a case of deemed
exports. The EOU on its own, however, is not entitled for refund of
TED, as the mandate to EOU is to procure or import goods from
DTA supplier, without payment of duty in view of the express ab

initio exemption provided in terms of para 6.2(b) read with para

34 To be published in the Gazette of India Extraordinary
Part II, Section 3, Sub-Section (II)
Government of India
45

6.11(c)(ii). However, despite such express obligation on the EOU, if
the EOU has had imported goods from DTA supplier by paying
TED, it can only claim the benefit of refund provided to DTA

supplier under para 8.4.2 read with paras 8.3(c) and 8.5 subject to

Notification No. 4 (RE-2013)/2009-2014
Dated: the 18" April, 2013

Subject: Amendments in Paragraph 8.3(c) and Paragraph 8.4 of FTP pertaining to
deemed exports scheme — Regarding.

S.O (E): In exercise of the powers conferred by Section 5 of the Foreign Trade
(Development & Regulation) Act, 1992, as amended, read with paragraph 1.3 of the Foreign
Trade Policy, 2009-2014, the Central Government hereby makes the following amendments in
Foreign Trade Policy, 2009-2014.

2. The existing paragraphs 8.3 (c) and 8.4 in the FTP are substituted by amended
paragraphs 8.3(c) and 8.4 as given below:

(i) Existing Paragraph 8.3 (c)

“Exemption from terminal excise duty where supplies are made against ICB. In
other cases, refund of terminal excise duty will be given. Exemption from TED shall
also be available for supplies made by an Advance Authorisation holder to a
manufacturer holding another Advance Authorisation if such manufacturer, in turn,
supplies the product(s) to an ultimate exporter.”

Amended Paragraph 8.3 (c)

“Refund of terminal excise duty will be given if exemption is not available.
Exemption from TED is available to the following categories of supplies:

(i) Supplies against ICB;

(ii) Supplies of intermediate goods, against invalidation letter,
made by an Advance Authorisation holder to another Advance
Authorisation holder; and

(iii) Supplies of goods by DTA unit to EOU / EHTP / STP / BTP unit

Thus such categories of supply which are exempt ab initio will not be eligible to
receive refund of TED”.

(ii) Existing Paragraph 8.4

“Following table shows the benefits available to different categories of supplies
as mentioned in Para 8.2 above. In respect of such supplies supplier shall be entitled
to the benefits listed in paragraphs 8.3 (a), (b) & (c) of the Policy, whichever is
applicable.

46

obtaining disclaimer from DTA supplier in that regard and

complying with other formalities and requirements.

29. We thus agree with the conclusion reached by the Bombay
High Court that the EOU is not entitled to claim refund of TED on
its own. However, we add a caveat that EOU may avail of the
entitlements of DTA supplier specified in Chapter 8 of FTP on
condition that it will not pass on that benefit back to DTA supplier
later on. In any case, the refund claim needs to be processed by
keeping in mind the procedure underlying the refund of CENVAT
credit/rebate of excise duty obligations. If CENVAT credit utilised
by DTA supplier or EOU, as the case may be, cannot be encashed,
there is no question of refunding the amount in cash. In that case,
the commensurate amount must be reversed to the CENVAT credit

account of the concerned entity instead of paying cash.

30. If, the claim for refund by DTA supplier under the scheme of
FTP is allowed, it can be in cash if TED had been paid in cash.
Else, it can be in the form of reversal of commensurate CENVAT

credit amount to the concerned account of DTA supplier.

sub-para of 8.2
47

31. As regards the refund claim of DTA supplier, as noted earlier,
it needs to be processed by the authorities under the FTP keeping
in mind the purport of stipulations spelt out in Chapter 8 of
subject FTP, such as the goods imported or supplied to EOU shall
be with actual user condition and shall be utilised for export
production and that the EOU did not avail CENVAT credit or rebate
in relation to the goods supplied to EOU. Similarly, if the DTA
supplier has utilised the CENVAT credit, commensurate amount
needs to be reversed to its CENVAT credit account, in which case,
there is no question of refunding the amount in cash to the DTA

supplier.

32. We shall now revert to the judicial pronouncements dealing
with the subject FTP. Except the decision of the Bombay High
Court commended to us, which is under challenge in the first two
appeals pertaining to refund claim by EOU, all other reported
decisions are in respect of DTA’ supplier of specified

goods/services.

33. The earliest decision is that of the learned Single Judge of the

Calcutta High Court in IFGL Refractories Limited*’. The High

35 supra at Footnote No.22
48

Court noted that the Export and Import Policy for the relevant
years was adopted amongst other to promote export of Indian
products to foreign countries aiming at to earn foreign exchange
and to increase global market. The scheme was propounded to
encourage indigenous supplier by providing certain benefits and
entitlements, either by way of exemption from payment of excise
duty or to get refund of excise duty, if already paid. The object of
the scheme was to provide exporters duty-free input for production
of export materials and for that reason, it exempted supplier from
payment of any excise duty and, if paid, to provide for refund of
TED. The High Court further noted that merely because such
refund was not permissible to the DTA supplier under the 1944 Act
and the rules framed thereunder, that would not deprive the DTA
supplier to avail of the entitlements and benefits under the FTP. It
held that it is open to the assessee to take advantage of any law,
particularly which is more beneficial. Accordingly, learned Single
Judge issued directions to pay the refundable amount along with
interest at the rate of 12 % per annum. The appeal filed by the

Department against the said decision was rejected by the Division
49

Bench of the Calcutta High Court in Joint Director General of

Foreign Trade’*’. The Division Bench, however, directed the DGFT
to refund TED amount as it was the concerned Authority under the
FTP, subject to assessee completing necessary formalities as
provided for in the FTP. This decision was then affirmed by this
Court consequent to dismissal of special leave petition being S.L.P.

(C) No.5368 of 2002, on 7.10.2002.

34. The next decision is of the High Court of Gujarat in the case
of Commissioner of Central Excise and Customs vs. NBM
Industries*®’. The Division Bench of the High Court considered the
question whether DTA supplier of goods to EOU is entitled for
refund of the CENVAT credit despite Rule 5 of the 2004 Rules,
dealing with refund of CENVAT credit. The Authorities had held
that not being a case of export of goods out of India, the assessee
was not entitled for refund of CENVAT credit amount utilised in
respect of subject goods supplied to EOU. The High Court relying

36 supra at Footnote No.19

37 2012 (276) ELT 9 (Guj.)
50

on its earlier decision in Commissioner of Central Excise vs.

Shilpa Copper Wire Industries*’, negatived that stand of the
Department. Instead, the High Court held that the claim for
refund was in reference to the applicable FTP and not on the basis
of the provisions of the 1944 Act and the rules framed thereunder.
The entithkement of DTA supplier was specified in the applicable FTP
being deemed exports which in law are regarded as_ physical
exports for the purpose of entitling refund of unutilised CENVAT

credit.

35. Then came the decision of the High Court of Delhi in Kandoi

Metal Powders Manufacturing Company Private Limited’’.
Even, this was a case of supplier manufacturing goods supplied to
EOU in reference to the applicable FTP. The High Court not only
relied on the decision of the Division Bench of the Calcutta High
Court in Joint Director General of Foreign Trade*’, but

38 2011 (269) ELT 17 (Guj.)

39 supra at Footnote No.18

40 supra at Footnote No.19
51

independently opined that DGFT having formulated the FTP, the
claim of the assessee was governed by the entitlements specified
therein in paras 8.2, 8.3, 8.4 and 8.5 as applicable at the relevant
time. Accordingly, the High Court allowed the writ petition and
relegated the writ petitioner before the Authority concerned for
deciding the refund claim of the petitioner. This judgment has
been followed in subsequent decisions, not only by the coordinate

Benches of the High Court of Delhi, but also by other High Courts.

36. The Madras High Court in the case of Raja Crowns and

Cans Pvt. Limited vs. Union of India* dealt with similar claim of
the DTA supplier of goods to EOU and whilst following the
decisions of the High Court of Delhi and Calcutta High Court
referred to above, opined that the assessee was entitled to maintain
an application for refund of TED. The High Court, accordingly,
directed the Authorities concerned to consider the refund

application of the writ petitioner. Later on, the Madras High Court

41 2015 (317) ELT 40 (Mad.)
52

took the same view in Lenovo (India) Pvt. Ltd.** and Manali
Petrochemical Limited vs. Additional Director General of

Foreign Trade, New Delhi & Anr.*’.

37. As aforesaid, the decision in Kandoit Metal Powders
Manufacturing Company Private’  Limited** has_ been
subsequently followed by the High Court of Delhi in Union of
India vs. Alstom India Limited**, Commissioner of Central
Excise, Delhi II vs. Welspring Universal*’, Deepak Enterprises

vs. Union of India*’, Alstom Transport India Ltd. vs. Union of

India**, Motherson Sumi Electric Wires vs. Union of India*’,
Multitex Filtration Engineers Limited vs. Union of India’? and

Hindustan Tin Works Limited vs. Union of India”’.

38. The view taken by the Calcutta High Court and followed by

the High Court of Delhi commended even to the High Court of

Karnataka in Acer India Put. Ltd.””.

39. The view taken in these decisions at the instance of the DTA
supplier of specified goods to EOU is in consonance with the view
taken by us in this judgment. To that extent, we affirm these
decisions and hold that the DTA supplier of goods to EOU would be

entitled for refund of TED on the basis of applicable para 6.1 1(a)

48 2018 (363) ELT 69 (Del.)

49 2018 (364) ELT 91 (Del.)

50 2020 (373) ELT 68 (Del.)

51 2020 (373) ELT 217 (Del.)

52 supra at Footnote No.21
54

read with paras 8.3(c), 8.4.2 and 8.5 of the FTP under
consideration. The modality of refund, however, ought to be in the
form of reversal of commensurate amount in the CENVAT credit
account of the DTA supplier, if the DTA supplier had utilized
CENVAT credit account in respect of goods supplied to EOU; and if
it had paid the amount in cash, the DTA supplier would be entitled
for refund of cash with simple interest at the rate of 6% per annum
as provided in para 8.5.1 of the applicable FTP on delay in refund

of duty drawback and TED under deemed exports scheme.

40. Reverting to the case of EOU considered by the Bombay High
Court in the inpugned judgment, we hold that EOU is entitled only
for ab initio exemption from payment of central excise duty in
terms of para 6.11(c)(ii) of the FTP; and obliged to import the goods
from DTA supplier without payment of duty in terms of para 6.2(b)
of the FTP. The arrangement provided in para 6.11(a) is, however,
in the nature of “benefit” given to EOU in the event it had paid the
amount towards TED in relation to goods procured by it to DTA
supplier. In that case, EOU will be eligible only for obtaining

entitlements of DTA supplier as specified in Chapter 8 of the FTP
55

upon obtaining a _ suitable disclaimer from DTA_ supplier.
Accordingly, in addition to ab initio exemption, the EOU is
additionally eligible to receive entitlements of DTA supplier as
specified in Chapter 8 of the FTP subject to complying with
necessary requirements and formalities. In other words, EOU is
not entitled for refund of TED on its own accord, but can avail of
the entitlements of DTA supplier on complying essential procedure.
As mentioned earlier, the interest on the refundable amount, if
paid in cash ought to be refunded with simple interest at the rate
of 6% per annum as provided in para 8.5.1 of the applicable FTP,

even in the case of application for refund by EOU.

41. The next question is: the refund claim should be set up before
which Authority? As noted earlier, since the entitlement of
exemption and refund of TED flows from the provisions of 1992 Act
and FIP framed thereunder by the Central Government, which is
an independent dispensation than the one provided in the 1944
Act and the rules framed thereunder, with the avowed purpose of
promoting export and earning foreign exchange, it is the obligation

of Authority responsible to implement the subject FTP, to deal with
56

refund claim of the concerned entities. For, it is not a case of
refund under the 1944 Act or 2002 Rules or 2004 Rules as such,

but under the applicable FTP.

42. In conclusion, we hold that the EOU entities, who had
procured and imported specified goods from DTA supplier, are
entitled to do so without payment of duty [as in para 6.2(b)] having
been ab initio exempted from such liability under para 6.1 1(c)(ii) of
the FTP, being deemed exports. Besides this, there is no other
entitlement of EOU under the applicable FTP. Indeed, under para
6.11(a) of the FTP, EOU is additionally eligible merely to avail of
entitlements of DTA supplier as specified in Chapter 8 of the FTP
upon production of a suitable disclaimer from the DTA supplier
and subject to compliance of necessary formalities and
stipulations. It would not be a case of entitkement of EOU, but only
a benefit passed on to EOU for having paid such amount to the
DTA supplier, which was otherwise ab initio exempted in terms of
para 6.11(c)(ii) of the FTP coupled with the obligation to import the

same without payment of duty under para 6.2(b).
57

43. Besides, if the DTA supplier as well as EOU had utilized its
CENVAT credit for importing goods in question, the refund would
be in the form of reversal of commensurate amount of CENVAT
credit to the account of the concerned entity. However, if TED has
been paid in cash by the EOU, the EOU may get refund of that
amount from Authority implementing the applicable FTP in cash
with simple interest at the rate of 6% per annum for the delayed
refund of duty (para 8.5.1) on condition that it would not pass on

that benefit to the DTA supplier owing to such refund/rebate.

44, As regards DTA supplier of goods to EOU, it is entitled to
receive the refund of TED in terms of para 8.3(c) read with paras
8.4.2 and 8.5 of the applicable FTP subject to complying necessary
formalities and stipulations provided therein, being a case of
deemed exports. Even, in the case of DTA supplier of goods to
EOU, if TED has been paid by utilizing CENVAT credit, the refund
would be in the form of reversal of commensurate amount in its
CENVAT credit account. And if the amount towards TED has been
paid in cash by the DTA supplier to the Authorities under the 1944

Act, the refund of TED amount would be made by the Authority
58

implementing the applicable FTP in cash with simple interest at the
rate of 6% per annum for the delay in refund of TED as per para

8.5.1.

45. In both cases, as aforesaid, responsibility of refund of TED in
reference to applicable FTP would be that of the Authority
responsible to implement the FTP under the 1992 Act, which has
had consciously accorded such entitlements/benefits for promoting
export and earning foreign exchange. Further, the fact that the
concerned entity had unsuccessfully applied for refund to the
Authorities under the 1944 Act and the rules made thereunder,
that would not denude it of its entitlement to get refund of TED
under the FTP, as may be applicable being mutually exclusive
remedies. It is so because it is well settled that the assessee is free

to take benefit of more beneficial regime.

46. Learned counsel for the parties had referred to other
decisions, which in our opinion need not be dealt with as the same
are not directly dealing with the issue(s) answered in these cases,

in particular dispensation provided under the applicable FTP.
59

47. In view of the above, the appeals filed by the assessee (EOU)
against the decision of the Bombay High Court partly succeed in
the above terms; and the appeals filed by the Department against
the decision of the High Court of Delhi and High Court of
Karnataka are also partly allowed in the aforementioned terms.

There shall be no order as to costs.

Pending application(s), if any, are disposed of accordingly.

JUDGMENT

A.M. Khanwilkar, J.

Verified

Leave granted.

2. The core issue in these appeals is: whether an appeal could
be filed before the Divisional Commissioner against an order
passed by the Collector under Section 14B(1) of the Maharashtra
Village Panchayats Act, 1959’, declining to disqualify a
Sarpanch/Member of the Panchayat for allegedly having failed to
lodge an account of election expenses within the time and in the
manner prescribed by the State Election Commission, without

offering any good reason or justification for such failure?

3. Briefly stated, the appellants contested elections held in
September, 2018 for electing a new Panchayat. The appellant in
appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 295/2021 had been directly
elected as a Sarpanch of Village Panchayat, Kusumba, Taluka and
District Dhule in the State of Maharashtra, from public, whereas,
the appellant in appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 451/2021 was

elected as a member of the same Village Panchayat.

4. Respondent No. 2 filed two Dispute Applications being Nos.
10/2019 and 11/2019 in the office of respondent No. 5 — Collector,

seeking declaration under Section 14B(1) - that the appellants

1 for short, “the 1959 Act”
3

herein stood disqualified for not submitting the election expenses
within the stipulated time. The Collector, after considering the
relevant material and the submissions of the rival parties, rejected
both the Dispute Applications by separate judgment and order

dated 5.2.2019 being devoid of merits.

5. The respondent No. 2 thereafter carried the matter in appeal
before the Divisional Commissioner, Nasik Region, Nasik’,
questioning the correctness of the rejection of his Dispute
Applications by the Collector. The Divisional Commissioner
allowed both the appeals by separate judgment and order dated
15.7.2019 and thereby declaring the appellants as disqualified and

ineligible to remain as Gram Panchayat Sarpanch/Member.

6. Feeling aggrieved, the appellants filed writ petitions before the
High Court of Judicature at Bombay Bench at Aurangabad’ being

Writ Petition Nos. 9244/2019 and 9245/2019.

7. AS common question had arisen for consideration, the High

Court vide impugned common judgment and order dated

2 for short, “the Divisional Commissioner”

3 for short, “the High Court”
4

17.12.2020, dismissed both the writ petitions and affirmed the
order of disqualification passed by the Divisional Commissioner

against the appellants herein.

8. The principal challenge before the High Court was about the
jurisdiction of the Divisional Commissioner to entertain the appeals
as filed by the respondent No. 2. For, the 1959 Act does not
provide for an appeal against the order passed by the Collector
under Section 14B(1) in rejecting the application for declaring the
incumbent member as disqualified. Further, the remedy provided
for consequent to the decision of the Collector under Section 14B(1)
before the Divisional Commissioner, is limited to removing the
disqualification or reducing the period of any such disqualification.
However, in a case where the Collector rejects the application for
disqualification of Sarpanch/Member, no further remedy of appeal
is provided for in the 1959 Act. The High Court negatived this
contention and opined that it was open to the aggrieved
applicant(s) to assail such decision of the Collector, by way of an
appeal under Section 14B(2) before the Divisional Commissioner.

To buttress this conclusion, the High Court drew analogy from
5

remedy of appeal against order of Collector under Section 16(2)

before the Divisional Commissioner under Section 16(2) and then
adverted to the decision in Suchita Murlidhar Kewati

(Sarpanch) & Ors. vs. State of Maharashtra & Ors.* Further,
having rejected the objection regarding jurisdiction of the
Divisional Commissioner to entertain the appeal(s), the High Court
proceeded to affirm the view taken by the Divisional Commissioner
of reversing the decision of the Collector, on merits. Accordingly,

the writ petitions filed by the appellants came to be dismissed.

9. We have heard Mr. Sudhanshu S. Choudhari, learned counsel
for the appellants and Mr. Nishant R. Katneshwarkar, learned
counsel for the respondent No. 2. They have, more or less,
reiterated the stand taken before the High Court by the respective

parties.

10. The provision, for disqualifying, to be a member of a

Panchayat and to continue as such, is imbued in Section 14° of the

4 2013 (6) Mh.L.J. 414
5 Disqualifications. - (1) No person shall be a member of a Panchayat

1959 Act. One of the stipulations inserted by way of amendment
in 2010 with effect from 6.5.2010 is clause (j-4) in Section 14(1). It
predicates that a person, if disqualified by the State Election
Commission under Section 14B of the Act, shall not be a member
of a Panchayat or continue as such. Section 14B° was also
inserted by the same amendment Act in 2010. It enables the State
Election Commission to declare a person (member of the
Panchayat) as disqualified for being a member of the Panchayat or
for contesting an election for being a member for a period of five
years from the date of the order so passed, if he has failed to lodge

an account of election expenses within the time and in the manner

(j-4) has been disqualified by the State Election Commission under
section 14B; or

Election Commission is satisfied that a person, -

(a) has failed to lodge an account of election expenses within the time
and in the manner required by the State Election Commission, and

(b) has no good reason or justification for such failure,

the State Election Commission may, by an order published in the
Official Gazette, declare him to be disqualified and such person shall be
disqualified for being a member of panchayat or for contesting an election for
being a member for a period of five years from the date of this order.

(2) The State Election Commission may, for reasons to be recorded,
remove any disqualification under sub-section (1) or reduce the period of such

enables the State Election Commission to remove ' such

disqualification or reduce the period thereof.

11. Be it noted that the State Election Commission in exercise of
its enabling powers, vide Article 243-K of the Constitution of India
including Section 10A(2)’ of the 1959 Act, issued an order dated

19.11.2010® to delegate its powers, such as under Section 14B of

(2) The State Election Commissioner may, by order, delegate
any of his powers and functions to any officer of the Commission

STATE ELECTION COMMISSION, MAHARASHTRA
New Administrative Building, Opp. Ministry, Madam Cama Road,

Date: 19.11.2010

ORDER

Regarding conferring of powers to declare disqualification of the candidates
contesting the elections of Zilla Parishad, Panchayat Samiti and Village
Panchayats if they do not submit the expenditure account in the prescribed
manner.

No. SEC/ZPPS/2010/L.No.9/KA-7: Under the powers conferred vide Article
No. 243-K of the Indian Constitution, as well Section 9A(2) of the Maharashtra
Zilla Parishads and Panchayat Samitis Act, 1961 and Section 10A(2) of the
Bombay Village Panchayat Act, 1958 and in exercise of other powers, the State
Election Commissioner, Maharashtra pass the following order: -
8

the 1959 Act to the officers of the State Government. Clause B of
the stated order stipulates that powers conferred upon the State
Election Commission under Section 14B(1) shall vest in the
concerned Collector of the District and powers conferred on it
under Section 14B(2) shall vest with the concerned Divisional

Commissioner.

12. By virtue of this order, the State Election Commission has
had authorised the Collector to exercise its powers under Section
14B(1); whereas powers under Section 14B(2) by the Divisional
Commissioner. It follows that the concerned State Government
officials are ordained to exercise the assigned power in silos. Ergo,
the power of State Election Commission under Section 14B(1) to

declare that the Sarpanch/Member of a Panchayat as disqualified,

(A) The powers conferred under the provisions of Section 15(B)(1) and
62(A) of the Maharashtra Zilla Parishads and Panchayat Samitis Act,
1961 are hereby vested in concerned Collector. Similarly the powers
conferred under Section 15(B)(2) and 62(B)(1) are hereby vested in
concerned Divisional Commissioners.

(B) The powers conferred under the provisions of Section 14(B)(1) of
the Bombay Village Panchayats Act, 1958 are hereby vested in
concerned Collector. Similarly the powers conferred under Section
14(B)(2) are hereby vested in concerned Divisional Commissioners.

By the order of Election Commissioner

(emphasis supplied)

is to be exercised by the Collector and not the Divisional
Commissioner. Similarly, the Divisional Commissioner can
exercise power only in respect of matters specified in Section
14B(2) - to remove the disqualification incurred under sub-Section
(1) or reduce the period of such disqualification. In either case, the
power to decide concerned issues is that of the State Election
Commission, which thenceforth could be exercised by its
concerned delegatee in respect of matters specified in the stated

order.

13. Notably, no appeal is provided against the order of Collector
(or of State Election Commission) refusing to disqualify the
Sarpanch/Member under Section 14B(1). Similarly, no appeal is
provided even against the order of the Divisional Commissioner (or
of State Election Commission) under Section 14B(2). A limited
window against the order under Section 14B(1) passed by the
Collector (or State Election Commission itself) declaring the
Sarpanch/Member of a Panchayat as disqualified, is kept open
before the Divisional Commissioner (or the State Election

Commissioner, if the order under Section 14B(1) is or were to be
10

passed by the State Election Commission itself) - to remove such
disqualification or to reduce the period thereof in deserving cases.
To put it tersely, for the nature of power exercised by the State
Election Commission under Section 14B, no remedy of appeal is

envisioned by the statute.

14. The power of the State Election Commission, bestowed under
sub-Section (1) or (2) of Section 14B, though concerns subject of
disqualification of a person, it operates in two different silos. In
that, the power under Section 14B(2) gets triggered only after an
order of disqualification is passed under Section 14B(1). The
former is not activated at all in a case where the application or the
proceedings to declare the Sarpanch/Member as disqualified, is
rejected or dropped. Taking any other view would inevitably result
in a situation where the power exercised by the State Election
Commission under Section 14B(1) could be appealed against before
itself (its delegatee). That cannot be countenanced. For, an appeal
cannot lie before the same Authority/functionary who had passed
the order of rejection of prayer to declare the member concerned as

disqualified. Sans an express statutory intent to provide appeal
11

against the order rejecting application to declare a _ person
disqualified, it must follow that upon passing such order the power
under Section 14B is fully exhausted by the State Election

Commission (or its delegatee, as the case may be).

15. Indubitably, an authority rejecting the proposal regarding
disqualification, cannot sit “in appeal” over its own order of
rejection. Notably, there is no express power bestowed upon the
State Election Commission or its delegatee to review its own
decision passed under Section 14B(1) or 14B(2) of the Act, as the
case may be. The argument of the respondent No. 2 that the power
bestowed on the Divisional Commissioner under Section 14B(2)
posits power to impose disqualification by virtue of Section 21 of
the General Clauses Act, 1897, does not commend to us and the
same needs to be merely stated to be rejected. Similarly, we reject
the argument of the respondent No. 2 that it is a case of Casus
Omissus. Whereas, the legislative intent and the setting in which
the relevant provisions are couched leaves no manner of doubt that

such power had not been given to the delegatee (Divisional
12

Commissioner), as it does not inhere in the State Election

Commission itself.

16. The High Court, however, answered the question by referring
to the logic under Section 16(2)° of the Act. We hasten to observe
that the High Court posed a wrong question to itself in paragraph 2
of the impugned judgment (whether the Divisional Commissioner
had jurisdiction to entertain an appeal under “Section 16(2)”

against an order of Collector under Section 14B(1) refusing to

9 16. Disability from continuing as member. - (1) If any member of a
Panchayat

(a) who is elected or appointed as such, was subject to any of the
disqualification mentioned in Section 14 at the time of his election or
appointment, or

(b) during the term for which he has been elected or appointed
incurs any of the disqualifications mentioned in Section 14, he shall be
disabled from continuing to be a member, and his office shall become
vacant.

(2) If any question whether a vacancy has occurred under this Section is
raised by the Collector suo motu or on an application made to him by any
person in that behalf, the Collector shall decide the question as far as possible
within sixty days from the date of receipt of such application. Until the
Collector decides the question, the member shall not be disabled under sub-
section (1) from continuing to be a member. Any person aggrieved by the
decision of the Collector may, within a period of fifteen days from the
date of such decision, appeal to the State Government, and the orders
passed by the State Government in such appeal shall be final:

Provided that no order shall be passed under this sub-section by the
Collector against any member without giving him a reasonable opportunity of
being heard.

(emphasis supplied)
13

disqualify a Sarpanch/Member), and as a result of which arrived at

the wrong conclusion.

17. Concededly, Section 16 is a provision which speaks about the
disability from continuing as the member of a _ Panchayat,
consequent to incurring disqualification or has been so declared
under Section 14 of the Act. Once a Sarpanch/Member is
disqualified under Section 14B by virtue of an order under Section
14B(1), it would give rise to two situations — the first is that the
person concerned can invoke option under Section 14B(2) for
removal of his disqualification or for reduction of the period of such
disqualification. The second is the obligation fastened upon the
Collector to decide the issue as to whether vacancy has occurred
on account of such disqualification. That question is required to
be answered by the Collector in the first instance, in terms of
Section 16(2) and to take follow-up steps thereafter in filling up
such vacancy. The decision of the Collector on such question,
referable to sub-Section (2) of Section 16, however, has explicitly
been made appealable before the State Government or the delegate
of the State Government. That is, completely, a different regime

albeit a consequence of process referred to in Section 14B(1) - to
14

declare a Sarpanch or a member as_ having incurred
disqualification. This question decided by the Collector, is
essentially in his capacity as a delegatee of the State Election
Commission and, de jure, deemed to have been decided by the
State Election Commission itself. Be that as it may, the question
decided by the Collector under Section 16 is, in one sense, a
ministerial act bestowed upon him to ascertain whether vacancy
had arisen as a consequence of the disqualification order and to fill

up such vacancy.

18. A priori, if the State Election Commission or its delegatee were
to reject or drop the proceedings against the concerned person or
member initiated under Section 14B(1), as being devoid of merits
or for any other reason, the complainant does not have remedy of
appeal against such decision. Such an order becomes final and is
not appealable at all. Indeed, it can be assailed before the

constitutional court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.

19. The High Court has adverted to the decision in Suchita

Murlidhar Kewati’®’. Indeed, the exposition in that decision is in

the context of an application filed under Section 14B for a

10 supra at Footnote No. 4
15

declaration that the elected member had incurred disqualification.
However, the observations in paragraph 9 of the reported decision
have been completely misconstrued and misapplied to the fact

situation of the present case.

20. Our attention has also been drawn to yet another decision of
the same Bench of the High Court in Writ Petition No. 12276/2021
decided on 3.12.2021"'. In the said judgment, the legal position
has been correctly expounded that the processes under Section
14B(1) and Section 16 are completely different, though concern the
matter of disqualification and vacancy arising therefrom. In case,
the Collector rejects the complaint and drops the proceedings in
favour of concerned Sarpanch/Member, there would be no
question of accrual of any vacancy. In contradistinction, if the
Collector declares the member as having incurred disqualification,
the follow-up issue required to be considered by the Collector
under Section 16 then is to ascertain if any vacancy had arisen

because of such disqualification. The two are different processes.

11 Shri Gulabrao vs. State of Maharashtra & Ors. - Writ Petition No.
12276/2021 decided on 3.12.2021

21. Taking any view of the matter, the opinion of the High Court
in the impugned judgment cannot be countenanced. We conclude
that no remedy of appeal is envisaged against an order of the State
Election Commission or its delegatee — the Collector, under Section
14B(1), rejecting the complaint or to drop the proceedings for
declaration of a Sarpanch/Member having incurred
disqualification. That order becomes final and if passed by the
Collector as the delegatee, is deemed to have been passed by the
State Election Commission itself. Even the State Election
Commission cannot step in thereafter in any manner much less in
the guise of reconsideration or review of such order. It must follow
that the Divisional Commissioner would have no jurisdiction (ab

initio) to entertain assail to such an order of the Collector.

22. We are conscious of the fact that the High Court not only
negatived the objection regarding jurisdiction of the Divisional
Commissioner to entertain the stated appeals, but also affirmed
the decision on merits in reversing the order(s) of Collector
rejecting the Dispute Applications of the respondent No. 2. The

fact that the High Court ventured into the terrain of dealing with
17

merits of the case, does not require us to examine that question.
For, once it is held that the Divisional Commissioner had no
jurisdiction to entertain the appeal against the order of the
Collector under Section 14B(1) rejecting the complaint filed by the
respondent No. 2, no other issue needed examination by the High
Court at his instance. MResultantly, we decline to go into the
correctness of the decision of the Collector on merits in rejecting
the Dispute Applications filed by respondent No. 2, for a
declaration that the appellants had incurred disqualification. We
also do not wish to dilate on the plea urged by the respondent No.
2 that the appellants had disentitled themselves for indulgence of
this Court owing to their conduct, as we have held that the stated
order(s) of the Divisional Commissioner are without jurisdiction

and non-est in law.

23. Accordingly, these appeals succeed. The impugned common
judgment and order is set aside. As a result, the separate orders
passed by the Divisional Commissioner dated 15.7.2019 in the
respective appeals are also set aside and instead the writ petitions

filed by the appellants are allowed, thereby restoring the separate
18

orders passed by the Collector dated 5.2.2019, rejecting the stated

Dispute Application(s) filed by the respondent No. 2. There shall be

no order as to costs.
